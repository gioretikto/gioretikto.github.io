<h1>Paging</h1>

<p>Paging is a memory management scheme that allows the processes to be stored non-contiguosly in memory. The memory is divided into fixed size chunks called <b>page frames</b>. The OS breaks the program's address space (the collection of addresses used by the program) into fixed size chunks called <b>pages</b>, which are of same size as that of page frames. </p>

<p>Each page is associated with <i>age</i> that indicates how frequently the page is accessed. Obviously, the pages which are accessed frequently will have higher value of ages as compared to that of less frequently accessed pages. </p>
