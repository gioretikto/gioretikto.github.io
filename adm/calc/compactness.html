<h1>Compactness in ℝ</h1>

<p>Compactness is one of the most important notions in analysis. It will have several applications. In ℝ (and ℝ<sup><i>n</i></sup>), the simplest characterization of a compact set is that a set is compact if and only if it is <b>closed and bounded</b>. Another characterization is in terms of sequences (this is called sequential compactness), and the most general one (which works in spaces more general than ℝ<sup><i>n</i></sup> and spaces more general than metric spaces) is in terms of open covers. Theorem 3.4.8 proves the equivalence of these three properties for the case of subsets of ℝ (it is also true for subsets of ℝ<sup><i>n</i></sup>). When we talk about topological properties of ℝ (or ℝ<sup><i>n</i></sup>) such as compactness, unless we explicitly say otherwise, we always mean with respect to the Euclidean metric.</p>


<h2>Sequential Compactness.</h2>

<p>We start with a characterization of compactness in terms of sequences.</p>

<p><b>Definition 3.1.1</b>. A set <i>A</i> ⊆ ℝ is said to be sequentially compact if every sequence (<i>a<sub>n</sub></i>) of elements of <i>A</i> has a subsequence (<i>a<sub>n<sub>k</sub></sub></i>) converging to a point a in <i>A</i>. &emsp;□</p>

<p>For example, <i>A</i>  = (0, 1] is not sequentially compact since every subsequence of the sequence (1/<i>n</i>) converges to 0, but 0 &notin; <i>A</i>.</p>
