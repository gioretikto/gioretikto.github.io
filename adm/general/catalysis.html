<h1>Catalysis</h1>

<p>A <b>catalyst</b> is a substance that accelerates a reaction but undergoes no net chemical change. The catalyst lowers the activation energy of the reaction by providing an alternative path that avoids the slow, rate-determining step of the uncatalysed reaction (Fig. 1).</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 1</b>. A catalyst provides a different path with a lower activation energy. The result is an increase in the rate of formation of products.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Catalysts can be very effective; for instance, the activation energy for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in solution is 76 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> , and the reaction is slow at room temperature. When a little iodide ion is added, the activation energy falls to 57 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> and the rate constant increases by a factor of 2000. Enzymes, which are biological catalysts, are very specific and can have a dramatic effect on the reactions they control. For example, the enzyme catalase reduces the activation energy for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to 8 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to an acceleration of the reaction by a factor of 10 15 at 298 K.<br> A <b>homogeneous catalyst</b> is a catalyst in the same phase as the reaction mixture. For example, the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution is catalysed by bromide ion or catalase (Sections 23.5 and 23.6). A <b>heterogeneous catalyst</b> is a catalyst in a different phase from the reaction mixture. For example, the hydrogenation of ethene to ethane, a gas-phase reaction, is accelerated in the presence of a solid catalyst such as palladium, platinum, or nickel. The metal provides a surface upon which the reactants bind; this binding facilitates encounters between reactants and increases the rate of the reaction. We examine heterogeneous catalysis in Chapter 25 and consider only homogeneous catalysis here.</p>

<h2>Features of homogeneous catalysis</h2>

<p>We can obtain some idea of the mode of action of homogeneous catalysts by examining the kinetics of the bromide-catalysed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (aq) → 2 H<sub>2</sub>O(l) + O<sub>2</sub> (g)</p>
</div>

<p>The reaction is believed to proceed through the following pre-equilibrium:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> ⇌ H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O<br>
<i>K</i> = [H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>]/[H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>][H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>]</p>
</div>

<div class="eq">
<p>H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> + Br<sup>−</sup> → HOBr + H<sub>2</sub>O&emsp;&emsp; <i>v</i> = <i>k</i>[H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>][Br<sup>−</sup>]<br>
HOBr + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> → H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + O<sub>2</sub> + Br<sup>−</sup></p>
</div>

<p>where we have set the activity of H<sub>2</sub>O in the equilibrium constant equal to 1 and assumed that the thermodynamic properties of the other substances are ideal. The second step is rate-determining. Therefore, we can obtain the rate law of the overall reaction by setting the overall rate equal to the rate of the second step and using the equilibrium constant to express the concentration of H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> in terms of the reactants.<br> The result is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>d[O<sub>2</sub>]/d<i>t</i> = <i>k<sub>eff</sub></i>[H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>] [H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>][Br<sup>−</sup>]</p>
</div>

<p>with <i>k</i><sub>eff</sub> = <i>kK</i>, in agreement with the observed dependence of the rate on the Br<sup>−</sup> concentration and the pH of the solution. The observed activation energy is that of the
effective rate constant <i>kK</i>.<br> In <b>acid catalysis</b> the crucial step is the transfer of a proton to the substrate:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>X + HA → HX<sup>+</sup> + A<sup>−</sup> &emsp;&emsp; HX<sup>+</sup> → products</p>
</div>

<p>Acid catalysis is the primary process in the solvolysis of esters and keto–enol tautomerism. In <b>base catalysis</b>, a proton is transferred from the substrate to a base:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>XH + B → X<sup>−</sup> + BH<sup>+</sup> &emsp;&emsp; X<sup>−</sup> → products</p>
</div>

<p>Base catalysis is the primary step in the isomerization and halogenation of organic compounds, and of the Claisen and aldol condensation reactions.</p>
