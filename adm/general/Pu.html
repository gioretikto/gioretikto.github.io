<h1>Plutonium</h1>

<p>Plutonium radioactivity comes mainly from two relatively short lived isotopes: plutonium 241 (14.4-years period) and plutonium 238 (88-years period). Plutonium-241 is produced from uranium-235, as a result of neutron captures not followed by fission. Plutonium-238 is produced by neutron absorption in neptunium-237, which itself is produced by irradiation of uranium in a reactor followed by chemical separations. Plutonium-238 has a half-life of 87.7 years, decaying by alpha decay.  Plutonium-238 is used as an energy source in remote spatial missions. Its radioactive period close to one century ensures a long use. </p>

<p>Applications for Pu-238 include using it as a heat source for thermoelectric power devices. Radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) have been used to provide a source of power in remote locations, such as deep space probes. This plutonium isotope generates a large amount of heat through its decay process. The generated heat is converted into electric power via a thermocouple in the RTG. Small-scale application of 238Pu is also used to provide power to heart pacemakers. The concept behind the use of this material is a result of the half-life of the isotope, since its half-life is extremely long, changing out the power source is not necessary.</p>
