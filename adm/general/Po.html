<h1>Polonium</h1>

<p>While studying the ionizing power of the radiations from various uranium minerals, <a href="../../storia/Marie_Curie.html">Mme. Curie</a> noted that two of these minerals, pitchblende and chalcolite (copper uranyl phosphate) are much more active than uranium itself. “This fact,” she once wrote, “is very remarkable and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element much more active than uranium.” Later on in 1893, Pierre and Mme. Curie, in a joint publication wrote:</p>

<p>“Studies of the compounds of uranium and of thorium have shown ... that the property of emitting rays, which make the air conducting and which act on photographic plates, is a specific property of uranium and of thorium found in all the compounds of these metals, being weaker as the proportion of the active metal in the compound is itself smaller. The physical state of the substance seems to have an altogether secondary importance ... Hence, it appears very probable that if certain minerals are more active than uranium and thorium, it is because they contain a substance more active than these metals ... We have attempted to isolate this substance in pitchblende and the experiments have confirmed the foregoing conclusion ... The pitchblende (used) was about two and half times as active in producing ionization as uranium ... It was attacked with acids and the solution obtained was treated with hydrogen sulphide. The uranium and thorium remained in solution, (but) the precipitated sulphide contained a very active substance, together with lead, bismuth, copper,
arsenic, and antimony.”</p>

<p>The arsenic and antimony sulphides were dissolved out by means of ammonium sulphide, from the nitric acid solution of the residue, the lead was precipitated as sulphate. Ammonia was then added to separate the bismuth from the copper. The active substance was found to be largely associated with the resulting precipitate of bismuth hydroxide. The separation from bismuth proved difficult, but finally it was found that if the sulphides were heated to 700°, in an evacuated tube, the active sulphide was obtained as a black deposit in the cooler regions of the tube. The Curies then concluded: “By carrying out these operations, more and more active products are obtained. Finally, we obtained a substance whose activity is about 400 times as great as that of uranium ... We believe, therefore, that the substance we have isolated from pitchblende contains a hitherto unknown metal ... If the existence of this new metal is confirmed, we propose to call it polonium, after the name of the native country of one of us [Madame Curie].”</p>

<p>Polonium is found in small amounts in thorium and uranium minerals (where it was discovered by Marie Curie) as one of the decay products of the parent elements, Th or U. It can now be more readily made by bombarding bismuth in a reactor</p>

<p>All polonium istotopes have relatively short half-lives and this isotope, polonium 210, is the longest-lives wih <i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> = 138 days. The isotopes all have high activity and the handling problems are severe so that polonium chemistry is not fully explored.</p>
