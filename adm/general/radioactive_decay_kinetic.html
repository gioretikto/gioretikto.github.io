<h1>The Kinetics of Radioactive Decay</h1>

<p>The half-life for radioactive decay is that characteristic time during which half of the nuclei in any given sample will undergo decay. The half-life is independent of the amount of sample. Half-life provides an easy way to estimate the time required before a radioactive element is no longer a health hazard.</p>

<section class="def">
<p><b>Strontium-90</b>, for example, is a β emitter with a half-life of 29.1 years. Sr-90 emits only β radiation, however the high-energy gamma emitted by its Y-90 progeny is easily detected. The health problems associated with strontium-90 arise because calcium and strontium have similar chemical properties. Strontium-90 in grass and hay is incorporated into cow’s milk along with calcium and is then passed on to humans, where it lodges in the bones. Strontium-90 is taken into the body and deposited in bone, taking the place of calcium. Leaves of broad-leaved plants have less Sr than grass, so grazing herbivores have a higher Sr/Ca ratio than browsing herbivores  Enamel apatite is best for Sr/Ca analysis. Radiation damage by strontium-90 (a β emitter) in bone has been directly linked to bone-related cancers. In addition significant quantities of strontium-90 were dispersed into the environment in atmospheric nuclear bomb tests in the 1960s and 1970s, and, from the half-life, we know that almost one half is still around.</p>

<p>It is fairly easy to measure the half-life of a short-lived radioisotope; we can measure the rate of radioactive decays using a Geiger counter. Because radioactive decay is a first-order process, the rate of decay is proportional to the number of atoms left. The rate of nuclear decay is determined from measurements of the <b>activity</b> (A) of a sample. Activity refers to the number of disintegrations observed per unit of time, a quantity that can be measured readily with devices such as a Geiger–Müller counter. Activity is proportional to the number of radioactive atoms present (<i>N</i>).:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>A</i> &prop; <i>N</i></p>
</div>

<p>If the number of radioactive nuclei <i>N</i> is reduced by half, the activity of the sample will be half as large. Doubling <i>N</i> will double the activity. This evidence indicates that the rate of decomposition is first order with respect to <i>N</i>. Consequently, the equations describing rates of radioactive decay are the same as those used to describe the kinetics of first-order chemical reactions; the change in the number of radioactive atoms <i>N</i> per unit of time is proportional to <i>N</i>. Since the process is continuos;</p></p>

<div class="eq">
<p>d<i>N</i>/d<i>t</i> = −<i>kN</i></p>
</div>

<p>The integrated rate equation can be written in two ways depending on the data used:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>ln(<i>N</i>/<i>N</i><sub>0</sub>) = −<i>kt</i></p>
</div>

<p>or</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>ln(<i>A</i>/<i>A</i><sub>0</sub>) = −<i>kt</i></p>
</div>

<p>Here, <i>N</i><sub>0</sub> and <i>A</i><sub>0</sub> are the number of atoms and the activity of the sample initially, respectively, and N and A are the number of atoms and the activity of the sample after time <i>t</i>, respectively. Thus, <i>N</i>/<i>N</i><sub>0</sub> is the fraction of atoms remaining after a given time (<i>t</i>), and <i>A</i>/<i>A</i><sub>0</sub> is the fraction of the activity remaining after the same period. By taking the exponential of both sides</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>N</i> = <i>N</i><sub>0</sub> e<sup>−<i>kt</i></sup></p>
</div>

<p>In these equations, <i>k</i> is the rate constant (decay constant) for the isotope in question. By substituting <i>N</i> = 1/2 ⋅ N<sub>0</sub> and <i>t</i> = <i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> into the previous equation, we find that</p> 

<div class="eq">
<p>1/2 = e<sup>−<i>kt</i><sub>1/2</sub></sup><br>
<i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> = ln 2/<i>k</i> = 0.693/<i>k</i></p>
</div>

<p><b>Exercise</b>. The activity of a radioactive substance in a sample at a given instant is 1/<i>&lambda;</i> of what it was an hour before. What is the half-life (in hours) of the substance in the sample?</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>. We have to calculate, <i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> = ln 2/ ln <i>k</i>. To obtain <i>k</i> we use the fact that</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>ln(A/A<sub>0</sub>) = −<i>kt</i><br>
ln(1/<i>&lambda;</i>) = −<i>k</i> &emsp;(after 1 hour)<br>
ln(<i>&lambda;</i>)  = <i>k</i></p>
</div>

<p>Thus <i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> = ln 2/ ln <i>&lambda;</i>. &emsp;■</p>

<p>The previous Equations are useful in several ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>If the activity (<i>A</i>) or the number of radioactive nuclei (<i>N</i>) is measured in the laboratory over some period <i>t</i>, then <i>k</i> can be calculated. The decay constant <i>k</i> can then be used to determine the half-life of the sample.</p></li>

	<li><p>If <i>k</i> is known, the fraction of a radioactive sample (<i>N</i>/<i>N</i><sub>0</sub>) still present after some time t has elapsed can be calculated.</p></li>

	<li><p>If <i>k</i> is known, the time required for that isotope to decay to a fraction of the original activity (<i>A</i>/<i>A</i><sub>0</sub>) can be calculated.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Although you might be able to obtain the half-life of a radioactive nucleus by direct observation in some cases, this is impossible for many nuclei because they decay too quickly or too slowly. Uranium-238, for example, has a half-life of 4.51 billion years, much too long to be directly observed! The usual method of determining the half-life is by measuring decay rates and relating them to half-lives.</p>

<p>The half-lives of radioactive nuclides vary over a tremendous range. For example, 146Nd has a half-life of 5 x 10<sup>15</sup> years, whereas 218 4 4 Po has a half-life of 2 x 10<sup>−4</sup> second. To give perspective on this, the half-lives of the nuclides in the 239U decay series are given in Table 1.</p>
