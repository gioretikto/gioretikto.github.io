<h1>The Alkali earth Metals, group IIA</h1>

<p>Il nome <i>terroso</i> ha origini remote, risalendo agli alchimisti medioevali che chiamavano terra qualsiasi sostanza che non fondeva e non si trasformava in un'altra quando era scaldata. I composti degli elementi del gruppo I A, come Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> ed NaOH, risultavano chiaramente alcalini perché neutralizzavano gli acidi ma non potevano essere chiamati terre poiché alcuni di essi se scaldati, fondevano oppure si combinavano con i contenitori di argilla adoperati. <br>I composti degli elementi del gruppo II A, invece, vennero chiamati <i>terre alcaline</i>, poiché il loro comportamento risultatva alcalino e non subivano alcuna alterazione al calore, dato che il loro punti di fusione sono elevati (per CaO, ad esempio, il punto di fusione è 2572 °C, temperatura ben al di sopra di quella di una fiamma ordinaria.</p>

<p>The alkaline earth metals belong to group 2 of the periodic table and have 2<i>s</i>-orbital electrons in their outer shell. They form compounds in oxidation state +II and appear in aqueous solutions as M<sup>2+</sup> ions. Alkaline earth metals are moderately electropositive, but less electropositive than the alkali metals since their charge is twice as large. The electropositivity of the alkaline earth metals increases with the atomic number as follows:</p>

<pre>Be &lt; Mg &lt; Ca &lt; Sr &lt; Ba &lt; Ra</pre>

<p>Like the Group 1A elements, the Group 2A elements are very reactive, so they are found in nature as compounds. Unlike most of the compounds of the Group 1A metals, however, many compounds of the Group 2A elements have low water-solubility, which explains their occurrence in various minerals (Figure 21.12). Calcium minerals include limestone (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), gypsum (CaSO<sub>4</sub> ∙ 2 H<sub>2</sub> O), and fluorite (CaF<sub>2</sub>). Magnesite (MgCO<sub>3</sub>), talc or soapstone (3 MgO ∙ 4 SiO<sub>2</sub> ∙ H<sub>2</sub>O), and asbestos (3 MgO ∙ 4 SiO<sub>2</sub> ∙ 2H<sub>2</sub>O) are common magnesium-containing minerals. The mineral dolomite, MgCa(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, contains both magnesium and calcium. Limestone, a sedimentary rock, is found widely on the earth’s surface. Many of these deposits contain the fossilized remains of marine life. Other forms of calcium carbonate include marble and Icelandic spar, the latter occurring as large, clear crystals with the interesting optical property of birefringence.</p>

<p>Because they are electropositive, the alkaline earth metals, like the alkali metals, mostly form ionic bonds, and most of their common compounds, like halides, are highly soluble, though quite a number are sparingly soluble. These elements are commonly called the <b>alkaline earth metals</b> because of the basicity of their oxides:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>MO(s) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) ⟶ M<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + 2OH<sup>−</sup> (aq)</p>
</div>

<p>Only the amphoteric beryllium oxide (BeO) also shows some acidic properties, such as dissolving in aqueous solutions containing hydroxide ions:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>BeO(s) + 2OH<sup>−</sup> (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) ⟶ Be(OH)<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> (aq)</p>
</div>

<p>The more active alkaline earth metals react with water as the alkali metals do, producing hydrogen gas:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>M(s) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) ⟶ M<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + 2OH<sup>−</sup> (aq) + H<sub>2</sub> (g)</p>
</div>

<p>Calcium, strontium, and barium react vigorously at 25°C. The less easily oxidized beryllium and magnesium show no observable reaction with water at 25°C, although magnesium reacts with boiling water. Table 1 summarizes various properties, sources, and methods of preparation of the alkaline earth metals.<br> The alkaline earth metals have great practical importance. Calcium and magnesium ions are essential for human life. Calcium is found primarily in the structural minerals composing bones and teeth. Magnesium (as the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion) plays a vital role in metabolism and in muscle functions. Because magnesium metal has a relatively low density and displays moderate strength, it is a useful structural material, especially if alloyed with aluminum. Table 1 summarizes some important reactions involving the alkaline earth metals. <br> Relatively large concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions are often found in natural water supplies. These ions in this so-called <b>hard water</b> interfere with the action of detergents and form precipitates with soap. In Section 7.6 we saw that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is often removed by precipitation as CaCO<sub>3</sub> in large-scale water softening. In individual homes Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and other cations are removed by <b>ion exchange</b>. An <b>ion exchange resin</b> consists of large molecules (polymers) that have many ionic sites. A cation exchange resin is represented schematically in Fig. 1(a), showing Na<sup>+</sup> ions bound ionically to the SO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> groups that are covalently attached to the resin polymer. When hard water is passed over the resin, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> bind to the resin in place of Na<sup>+</sup>, which is released into the solution [Fig. 1(b)]. Replacing Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> by Na<sup>+</sup> [Fig. 1(c)] “softens” the water because the sodium salts of soap are soluble.</p>

<p>Beryllium is exceptional among the alkaline earth metals in its very small ion size (ionic radius 31 pm), and therefore it forms compounds with covalent bonds. In their ion size the alkaline earth metals follow the same trend as the alkali metals: the ion size increases with atomic number while the hydrated ion size increases in the reverse order. Alkaline earth metals hydrolyze more readily than alkali metals. Beryllium ions form a hydroxide at a pH as low as 5-6, and this hydroxide is amphoteric. Magnesium forms a hydroxide at pH 9-10, but the hydroxides of the others alkaline earth metals are highly soluble. However, calcium can also be precipitated as a hydroxide in highly alkaline solutions, while the heavier alkaline earth metals do not precipitate as hydroxides. The alkaline earth metals form sparingly soluble carbonates in alkaline solution, though magnesium carbonate is clearly more soluble than the carbonates of the heavier alkaline earth metals. Beryllium and magnesium hydroxides are less soluble than their carbonates.</p>

<p>Separations of radionuclides of the alkaline earth metals <sup>41,45</sup>Ca, <sup>89,90</sup>Sr, and <sup>226,228</sup>Ra are typically carried out with hydroxides and carbonates or phosphates. Hydroxide precipitations are used to remove hydrolyzable metals.</p>

<p>Like the alkali metals, the alkaline earth metals do not readily form coordination complexes with organic compounds because no vacancies occur in their electron shells with which to form coordination bonds.</p>

<h2>Abundance</h2>

<p>Beryllium is no very abundant in nature but is of some commercial importance. It is very toxic, leading to degeneration of the lung when inhaled. <i>Magnesium</i>, calcium, strontium and barium are widely distributed elements with large deposits of <i>limestone</i> (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) and <i>dolomite</i> (CaCO<sub>3</sub> MgCO<sub>3</sub>) in the earth's crust. Carbonate and bicarbonates of calcium and magnesium contribute to hardness of water due to leaching from rocks by water acidifid by the presence of carbon dioxide.</p>
