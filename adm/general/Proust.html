<h1>Law of contant composition of definite proportions</h1>

<p>By the end of the 18th century there was considerable debate as to whether the ratio of elements in a compound was dependent on the method by which the compountd was prepared. Much of this debate was due to inaccurate determinations of <b>atomic weight</b>. Proust noticed that copper carbonate—be it native or prepared in a lab—always broke down into the same proportions of copper, carbon, and oxygen by mass. There were about five parts of copper to four parts of oxygen to one part carbon − a constant ration of 5.3:4:1. In 1794 the French chemist Joseph-Louis Proust (1754–1826) developed the <b>law of definite proportions</b>:</p>

<blockquote>A chemical compount always contains same elements combined together in same proportions by mass. </blockquote>

<p>It implies from this law that in a chemical compound the elements are present in <i>fixed</i> and <i>not arbitrary</i> ration by mass. For example, pure water obtained from different source such as, sea, river or an industrial process always contains hydrogen and oxygen combined together in the ratio 1:8 by mass. Similarly carbon dioxide contains a carbon and oxygen in the ration of 3:8 by mass.</p>
