<h1>Valence bond (VB) theory</h1>

<p>The are two theories of covalent bonding that have evolved based on quantum theory: the <b>valence bond theory</b> (or <b>VB theory</b>) and the <a href="Mo.html">molecular orbital theory</a>. In VB theory, the atoms are considered to retain their identity and except valence shell atomic orbitals which overlap, the other atomic orbitals remain undisturbed. In case of <i>MO theory</i> (Hund and Mulliken, 1932), the atomic orbitals of the bonded atoms lose their identity, they mix up and form what is known as molecular orbitals. A molecular orbital may be conceived as the region in the space around the nuclei of all the bonded atoms where the probability of finding an electron is maximum.</p>

<p>Valence bond theory was proposed by Heitler and London in 1927 and later developed by Linus Pauling. Sone salient features of the theory are:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>A covalent bond is formed by the partial overlap of atomic orbitals of combining atoms. Complete overlap is not possible due to repulsion between nuclei.</p></li>
	<li><p>The atomic orbitals which are to overlap must be half filled and the unpaired electrons should have opposite spins.</p></li>
	<li><p>The strength of bond formed depends upon the extent of overlapping. The greater the overlapping, the stronger is the bond formed.</p></li>
	<li><p>Due to overlapping, electron pairing results with the net decrease in energy which imparts it greater stability.</p></li>
	<li><p>Only the valence electrons of the combining atoms participate in bonding, whereas, the inner orbitals from each atom remain undisturbed.</p></li>
	<li><p>The stability of the covalent bond is due to the exchange of valence electrons between the atoms involved in bond making.</p></li>
	<li><p>Depending upon the type of overlapping, the covalent bonds are of two types, i.e., sigma bonds and pi bonds.</p></li>
	<li><p>Valency of an element is equal to the number of half filled orbitals in the valence shell of the atom.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Limitations of VBT</h3>

<ol>
	<li><p>Since the two electrons of the shared pair constitute the covalent bond this theory does not give any explanation of the formation of a coordinate bond.</p></li>
	<li><p>The two atoms in O, molecule should have close electronic shells resembling those of Ne which would give no unpaired electrons to the molecule and thus, will make it diamagnetic.</p></li>
	<li><p>Actual experiments show that O, molecule is paramagnetic, indicating the presence of unpaired electrons in oxygen molecule.</p></li>
	<li><p>This theory does not consider the formation of odd electron molecules or ions such as H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> ion where no pairing of electrons occurs.
	<li><p>If fails to explain the bonding in metals and intermetallic compounds as well as the bonding in electron deficient compounds.</p></li>
