<h1>Close packing</h1>

<p>The constituent particles in the formation of crystals are either atoms, ions or molecules. These particles may be of various shapes and thus the mode of packing of these particles will change according to theirs shapres. The simple way will be to consider these particles as spheres of equal size (in metallic crystals particles are nearly of this type). The packing of spheres is done in such a way as to use the available space and hence the crystal has maximum density. This type of packing is called <b>close packing</b>. The closer the packing, the greater is the stability of the packed system.</p>

<h2>Close packing in One-dimension</h2>

<p>There is one way in which the spheres can be arranges in horizontal one-dimensional close packed structures, i.e., these spheres should be touching each other in a row as shown in Fig. 1. In this arrangement, co-ordinate number is 2.</p>

</figure>

<h2>Close packing in Two-dimension</h2>

<p>Then we place another row of spheres by the side of the first row. THis can be done in two ways. One way is depicted in Fig.1. Second method is shown in Fig.2. The first type is called <i>Square Close Packing</i> and the second type is called <i>Hexagonal Close Packing</i>.</p>

</figure>

<p>In square close packing, a sphere is surrounded by four spheres in the plane whereas in hexagoanl close packing, a sphere is surrounded by six spheres in the plane. Thus the empty space in square close packing is more as compared to that in hexagonal close packing. Or in other words, Hexagonal Close packing is more dense thatn the Square Close packing.</p>

<h2>Three dimensional packing</h2>

<p>Then we can form a second close-packed layer by placing spheres in the depressions of the ﬁrst layer (Fig. 3). The third layer may be added in either of two ways, both of which
result in the same degree of close packing. In one, the spheres are placed so that they reproduce the ﬁrst layer (Fig. 3), to give an ABA pattern of layers. Alternatively, the spheres may be placed over the gaps in the ﬁrst layer (Fig. 3), so giving an ABC pattern.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig.3. Closest packing of spheres</b>. (A) Each layer is formed by placing spheres in the crevices of the adjoining row. (B) When a sphere is placed in a hollow on top of a layer, three other hollows are partially covered. (C) There are two types of hollows on top of the second layer, labeled <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. The <i>x</i> sites are directly above the spheres in the ﬁrst layer; the <i>y</i> sites are not. Spheres of a third layer may occupy either all of the <i>x</i> sites or all of the <i>y</i> sites.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Two types of structures are formed if the two stacking patterns are repeated. The spheres are <b>hexagonally close-packed (hcp)</b> if the ABA pattern is repeated to give the sequence of layers ABABAB.... The name reﬂects the symmetry of the unit cell (Fig. 4). Metals with hcp structures include beryllium, cadmium, cobalt, manganese, titanium, and zinc. Solid helium (which forms only under pressure) also adopts this arrangement of atoms. Alternatively, the spheres are <b>cubic close-packed</b> (ccp) if the ABC pattern is repeated to give the sequence of layers ABCABC.... Here too, the name reﬂects the symmetry of the unit cell (Fig. 5). Metals with this structure include silver, aluminium, gold, calcium, copper, nickel, lead, and platinum. The noble gases other than helium also adopt a ccp structure.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig.4</b> A second layer with the same structure of the first is added. But this layer is slightly shifted and hence just filling the gaps of the first layer. In a third step another equivalent layer is added filling the gaps just as before but now there are two opportunities: Either this layer lies exactly above the first one (A) or it is shifted with respect to both A and B and thus has its own position C. </figcaption>

<p id="number">The compactness of the ccp and hcp structures is indicated by their <b>coordination number</b>, the number of atoms immediately surrounding any selected atom, which is 12 in both cases.</p>

<p>The cubic close-packed structure is also known as <b>face-centred cubic (fcc)</b>, as there are atoms on each of the faces of the cube, in addition to each of the eifght vertices. The face-centred cubic structure 

<p>A <b>unit cell</b> is the smallest possible repeating unit for a structure.</p>

<h2 id="bcc">Less closely packed structures</h2>

<p>As shown in Table 20.2, a number of common metals adopt structures that are less than close-packed. The departure from close packing suggests that factors such as speciﬁc covalent bonding between neighbouring atoms are beginning to inﬂuence the structure and impose a speciﬁc geometrical arrangement. One such arrangement results in a cubic I (<b>bcc</b>, for <b>body-centred cubic</b>) structure, with one sphere at the centre of a cube formed by eight others. The coordination number of a bcc structure is only 8, but there are six more atoms not much further away than the eight nearest neighbours. The packing fraction of 0.68 is not much smaller than the value for a close-packed structure (0.74), and shows that about two-thirds of the available space is actually occupied.</p>

<figcaption><b>Cubic unit cells</b>. The simple cubic unit cell has lattice points only at the corners; the body-centered cubic unit cell also has a lattice point at the center
of the cell; and the face-centered cubic unit cell has lattice points at the centers of each face in addition to those at the corners.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another cubic structure, and the simplest, is the so-called <b>primitive cubic structure</b> or <b>simple cubic</b>. There is only one metal that adopts this structure—polonium.</p>
