<h1>Metallic Bonding</h1>

<p>A third major type of chemical bonding is <b>metallic bonding</b>. Whereas <a href="ionic_bonding.html">ionic bonds</a> join metals to non-metals and covalent bonds join non-metals to each other, metallic bonding joins a bulk of metal atoms. A metallic substance may be a pure element (e.g. aluminum foil, copper wires), or it may be a mixture of two or more elements in an <b>alloy</b> (e.g. brass instruments, "white gold" jewelry). Metals tend to have high melting points and boiling points suggesting strong bonds between the atoms. Even a soft metal like sodium (melting point 97.8°C) melts at a considerably higher temperature than the element (neon) which precedes it in the Periodic Table. However, unlike ionic compounds, metals are usually malleable rather than brittle, suggesting that they do not form a rigid lattice structure of oppositely charged ions; neither do metals form bonded molecules like covalent compounds, however. A different model of bonding is necessary to explain the properties of metallic substances. In the 1900's, Paul Drüde came up with the "<b>sea of electrons</b>" metallic bonding theory by modeling metals as a mixture of atomic cores (atomic cores = positive nuclei + inner shell of electrons) and valence electrons. </p>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>Most metallic elements display close-packed structures (spheres, representing atoms, touching all their immediate neighbors), which represent the geometrically most compact arrangement of spheres in space. The close-packed arrangement results in crystal structures with hexagonal or cubic (face-centered and body-centered) symmetry. <br> They tend to adopt the cubic- and hexagonal-close-packed structures or the less closely packed body-centered-cubic structure. </p>

<figcaption>Crystal structures of metallic elements. (a) Cubic close-packed structure (Face-centered cubic, FCC), in which each atom is surrounded by 12 neighbors (e.g Cu, Ni, Au). (b) Hexagonal close-packed structure, in which each atom is surrounded by 12 neighbors, 6 at a slightly greater distance than the other 6 (e.g Mg, Ti, Zn). (c) Body-centered cubic structure, in which each atom is surrounded by 8 neighbors at the corners of a cube (e.g. Li, Na, Mo). Assuming the atoms to be perfect spheres, the packing efficiency (volume of the spheres occupied by the sphere/total volume) is 74.05% for both cubin and hexagonal close-packed structures; the body-centered cubic structures is not a close-packed array and its packing efficiency drops to 68.02%.</figcaption>

<h3>Body-Centered Cubic (BCC)</h3>

<p>An example of BCC is iron at room temperature or titanium above 882°C. This unit cell has one atom at the cube center and eight atoms at the comers of the cube. Since each cube corner is shared with eight other cubes, the BCC unit cell contains two atoms. Using the atom at the cube center as a reference, we can see that the coordination number (number of nearest neighbors) is eight. For cube side length <i>a</i> and atom radius <i>R</i>, assuming that the atom at the body center is in contact with its eight nearest neighbors, we can show that <i>a</i>√3 = 4<i>R</i> (see following example). From this information, we can calculate the ratio of volume occupied by the two atoms in the unit cell (assumed spherical) to the volume of the unit cell. This ratio is known as the packing factor. For the BCC unit cell, the packing factor is equal to &pi;√3/8, about 68%.</p>

<p><b>Example</b>. For the BCC unit cell, determine the relationship between the cube side length a and the atomic radius <i>R</i>. Calculate the packing factor.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>. Consider the arrangement of atoms along the body diagonal as shown (Figure 1.18). The length of the body diagonal is equal to <i>a</i>√3, and there are four atomic radii along the diagonal. Therefore, we have <i>a</i>√3 = 4<i>R</i>, or <i>R</i> = <i>a</i>√3/4.</p>

<h3>Face-Centered Cubic (FCC)</h3>

<p>An example of FCC is aluminum. This unit cell has eight atoms at the cube corners and six atoms at the cube faces. Since each atom at the cube face is shared by two cubes, the FCC unit cell contains four atoms. The coordination number is 12. Again, assuming close packing with nearest neighbors and spherical atoms, we can show that <i>a</i>√2 = 4<i>R</i>. The packing factor is equal to &pi;√2/6 or about 74%. Therefore, the FCC structure is more tightly packed than the BCC structure.</p>

<h3>Hexagonal Ciose Packed (HCP)</h3>

<p>An example of HCP is titanium below 882°C. The HCP structure can be obtained by stacking close-packed hexagonal planes of atoms on top of each other in the ABAB stacking sequence; that is, the stacking arrangement repeats every two layers. By convention, the unit vector along this packing direction is known as the c-axis, and the a- and b-axes are perpendicular to it. The FCC structure, on the other hand, can be obtained by stacking in the ABCABC sequence. Therefore, the nearest neighbor environments for HCP and FCC are similar. The coordination number (12) and packing factor (74%) for the HCP unit cell are the same as those for FCC.</p>

<h2>The Electron Sea Model</h2>

<p>In metal atoms, the valence electrons are few (1, 2 or 3) and thus it is not possible for a metal atom to form 8 to 12 covalent bonds with neighbouring atoms. Thus it was assumed that the atoms in metal crystal are bonded with each other with a special type of bonding known as <b>metallic bonding</b>. Drude in 1900 proposed the theory of metallic bonding which was later on odified by Lorentz. According to these scientists, metal atoms have only a few valence electrons, which are loosely held by the nucleus (because of small ionisation energy of metals), and can easily leave the field of influence of one metal ion and enter the field of influence of the other. Thus the electrons become collectively shared by all the ions. The valence electrons therefore become delocalised and form an electron gas or electron cloud. This simultaneous froce of attraction between the "free" electrons and the positive ions is responsible for holding the metal atoms and is known as <b>metallic bond</b>. Because of collective sharing of electrons the bond is <i>non-directional</i>.</p>
