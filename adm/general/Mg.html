<h1>Magnesium</h1>

<p>As well as being the most abundant Group 2 elements, magnesium and calcium are also the most important commercially. Magnesium is obtained from sea water, in which Mg<sup>2+</sup>
is the second most abundant cation. In the first stage of the process, aqueous calcium hydroxide solution is added to the sea water, causing the less soluble Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>, to precipitate</p>

<table class="noborder">
<tr><td>Mg<sup>2+</sup> (aq)</td> <td>+ Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>(aq)</td> <td>⟶</td> <td>Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s)</td> <td>+</td> <td>Ca<sup>2+</sup> (aq)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The solid magnesium hydroxide is then treated with hydrochloric acid to produce MgCl<sub>2</sub> and the metal is liberated from molten MgCl<sub>2</sub> using electrolysis</p>

<table class="noborder">
<tr><td>Mg<sup>2+</sup> (melt) </td> <td>+ 2e<sup>—</sup></td> <td>⟶</td> <td>Mg(I)</td> <td>reduction at the cathode</td></tr>
<tr><td>2Cl<sup>&minus;</sup> (melt) <td>⟶</td> <td>Cl<sub>2</sub> (g)</td> <td>+ 2e<sup>&minus;</sup></td> <td>oxidation at the anode</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Group 1 chlorides are added to the molten electrolyte to decrease the melting point of MgCl, and increase the energy efficiency of the electrolysis process.<br>
Another source of magnesium is from minerals such as magnesite (MgCO<sub>3</sub>) or dolomite (MgCO<sub>3</sub>⋅CaCO<sub>3</sub>). The production of magnesium from dolomite is a two-step process.Firstly, the carbonates are converted into oxides by heating</p>

<table class="noborder">
<tr><td>MgCO<sub>3</sub> ⋅ CaCO<sub>3</sub> (s)</td> <td>&Delta;<br>⟶</td> <td>MgO ⋅ CaO(s)</td> <td>+ 2CO<sub>2</sub>(g)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The oxides are then treated with an alloy of iron and silicon known as ferrosilicon. The silicon in this alloy reduces the Mg<sup>2+</sup> at a temperature of 1200°C. This is above the boiling
point of magnesium, so the metal vaporizes and is removed from the reaction mixture as a gas as soon as it is formed</p>

<table class="noborder">
<tr><td>2MgO⋅CaO</td> <td>+ Si</td> <td>&Delta;<br>⟶</td> <td>2Mg</td> <td>+ Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The main use of metallic magnesium is in aluminium alloys, though it is also used as a desulfurization agent in the steel industry and as a reducing agent.</p>
