<h1>Atomic spectra</h1>

<p>When atoms are excitied, either in an electric discharge or with heat, the atoms absorb energy through collisions with electrons and ions and may then release this energy as light emitted only at certain wavelenghts that are characteristic of the atom in the sample. These wavelenghts constitute what is called the atomic spectrum of the excited sample and reveal much of the detalied information we have redarding the electronic structure of atoms. If we excite a gas until it glows and pass the light emitted by the gas through a prima, only certain lines are projected onto the screen: the rest of the light spectrum has disappeared. But if we do it differenlty − that is, if we have the cold gas between the white light and the prism − then the full spectrum, excepts for <i>exactly</i> the same lines that were visible in the previous spectral measurement.</p>

<p>Johann Balmer (1825 - 1898), a Swiss mathematician, found experimentally adn without giving a physical explanation, in 1885 that the separation of the optical lines generated by hydrogen gas can be expressed by a formula using just a constant <i>C</i>, and integer numbers. He expressed it as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&lambda; = Cm<sup>2</sup>/(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup> − <i>2</i><sup>2</sup>)</p>
</div>

<p>here &lambda; is the wavelenght of the missing line, <i>C</i> is a contant (<i>C</i> = 3.64 ⋅ 10<sup>−9</sup> m), <i>n</i> is an integer greater than 2 (i.e. 3, 4 ,5 and so on). When you put these integer numbers in the formula, you ge the wavelenght of all the lines in the hydrogen spectrum.</p>

<p>Three years later, Johannes Rydberg (1854 - 1919) found that the Balmer equation was one specific case of a more general formula,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&nu; = 1/&lambda; = <i>R<sub>H</sub></i>[1/(<i>m</i><sup>2</sup> − <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>)</p>
</div>

<p>where <i>R<sub>H</sub></i> = 1.1 ⋅ 10<sup>7</sup> m<sup>−1</sup>, is called the <i>Rydberg constant</i>, and the same integer numbers, except that now <i>n</i> is allowed to have different integer numbers. The previous equation was able to predict the wavelenghts &lambda;<sub>mn</ub> between two states <i>m</i> and <i>n</i>, represented by integers. </p>

<p>While the Balmer formula was deduced on purely empirical grounds it was, as we shall see, crucial to the development of the Borh theory of hydrogen. Niels Bohr, was able to calculate Rydberg constant using fundamental physical values, such as the mass of the electron, the electronic charge, the permettivity of free space, Plank's constnat and the speed of light. </p>
