<h1>The Alkali Metals, group IA</h1>

<p>Dall’arabo al-qalī «potassa, ceneri bruciate». Le ceneri di legno contengono carbonato di potassio (potassa) ed erano usate nel passato come candeggianti, nella fabbricazione di vetri, ceramiche, saponi e come concime. Il simbolo dell'elemento «K» è tratto da <i>kalium</i> una parola latina per «cenere».</p>

<p>The Group 1A elements with their <i>ns</i><sup>1</sup> valence electron configurations are all very active metals (they lose their valence electrons very readily). We will not discuss francium here since it occurs in nature in only very small quantities. Although hydrogen is found in Group 1A, it behaves as a nonmetal, in contrast to the other members of that group. The fundamental reason for hydrogen’s nonmetallic character is its very small size (see Fig. 12.38). The electron in the small 1s orbital is bound very tightly to the nucleus.
Some important properties of the first five alkali metals are shown in Table 1. The data in Table 1 show that when we move down the group, the first ionization energy decreases and the atomic radius increases. This agrees with the general trends discussed in Section 12.15. The overall increase in density in going down Group 1A is typical of all groups. It occurs because atomic mass generally increases more rapidly than atomic size. The smooth decrease in melting point (mp) and boiling point (bp) in going down Group 1A is not typical; in most other groups, more complicated behavior occurs.</p>

<p id="cesium">Note that the melting point of cesium is only 29°C. Cesium can be melted readily from the heat of your hand. Cesium’s low melting point is very unusual—metals typically have high melting points. For example, tungsten melts at 34108C. The only other metals with low melting points are mercury (mp = −39°C) and gallium (mp = 30°C). <br> Recall that the chemical property most characteristic of a metal is the ability to lose its valence electrons.</p>

<section class="def">
<p><b>Cesium</b> was discovered in natural mineral waters in 1860 by R. W. Bunsen and G. R. Kirchhoff, using the spectroscope they invented in 1859. The name comes from the Latin word caesius, meaning “sky blue,” which describes the prominent blue line observed for this element at 455.5 nm. Calculate the frequency and energy of a photon of this light.</p>

<p>Within a nuclear reactor, two isotopes of cesium (134Cs and 137Cs) are formed. Cesium 134 and Cesium 137 have half-lives of 2 years and 30 years, respectively. Cesium-137, does not emit a gamma; Cs-137 is a pure beta-emitting radionuclide. But Cs-137 decays to form Ba-137 m, and Ba-137 m emits gamma radiation with a half-life of only about 6 min. Thus, while a gamma detector will not detect Cs-137, it is easily able to detect its Ba-137 m progeny. </p>
</section>

<p>The Group 1A elements are very reactive. They have low ionization energies and react readily with nonmetals to form ionic solids. A typical example involves the reaction of sodium with chlorine to form sodium chloride:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>2Na(s) + Cl<sub>2</sub> (g) ⟶ 2NaCl(s)</p>
</div>

<p>This is an oxidation–reduction reaction in which chlorine oxidizes sodium to form Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sub>2</sub> ions. In the reactions between metals and nonmetals, it is typical for the nonmetal to behave as the oxidizing agent and the metal to behave as the reducing agent, as shown by the following reactions:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>2Na(s) + S(s) ⟶ Na<sub>2</sub>S(s)&emsp;(Contains Na<sup>+</sup>  and S<sup>2−</sup> ions)</p>
</div>

<div class="eq">
<p>6Li(s) + N<sub>2</sub> (g) ⟶ 2Li<sub>3</sub> N(s) &emsp;(Contains Li<sup>+</sup> and N<sup>3−</sup> ions)</p>
</div>

<div class="eq">
<p>4Na(s) + O<sub>2</sub> (g) ⟶ 2Na<sub>2</sub>O(s) &emsp;(Contains Na<sup>+</sup> and O<sup>2−</sup> ions)</p>
</div>

<p>For reactions of this type, the relative reducing powers of the alkali metals can be predicted from the first ionization energies listed in Table 12.9. Since it is much easier to remove an electron from a cesium atom than from a lithium atom, cesium should be the better reducing agent. The expected trend in reducing ability is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Cs &gt; Rb &gt; K &gt; Na &gt; Li</p>
</div>

<p>This order is observed experimentally for direct reactions between the solid alkali metals and nonmetals. However, this order of reducing ability is not observed when the alkali metals react in aqueous solution. For example, the reduction of water by an alkali metal is very vigorous and exothermic with the release of hydrogen gas:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>2M(s) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) ⟶ H<sub>2</sub> (g) + 2M<sup>+</sup> (aq) + 2OH<sup>−</sup> (aq) + energy</p>
</div>

<p>The order of reducing abilities observed for this reaction (for the first three group members) is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Li &gt; K &gt; Na</p>
</div>

<p>which is not the order expected from the relative ionization energies of these metals. This unexpected order occurs because the formation of the M<sup>+</sup> ions in aqueous solution is strongly influenced by the hydration of these ions by the polar water molecules. The hydration energy of an ion represents the change in energy that occurs when water molecules attach to the M<sup>+</sup> ion. The hydration energies for the Li<sup>+</sup> , Na<sup>+</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup> ions shown in Table 2 indicate that the process is exothermic in each case. However, nearly twice as much energy is
released by the hydration of the Li<sup>+</sup> ion as compared with that of the K<sup>+</sup> ion. This difference is caused by size effects; the Li<sup>+</sup> ion is much smaller than the K<sup>+</sup>
ion, and thus its charge density (charge per unit volume) is much greater. This means that the polar water molecules are more strongly attracted to the small Li<sup>+</sup> ion. Because the Li<sup>+</sup> ion is so strongly hydrated, its formation from the lithium atom occurs more readily than the formation of the K<sup>+</sup> ion from the potassium atom. Although a potassium atom in the gas phase loses its valence electron more readily than a lithium atom in the gas phase, the opposite is true in aqueous solution. This anomaly is an example of the importance of the polarity of the water molecule in aqueous reactions. <br> There is one more surprise involving the highly exothermic reactions of the alkali metals with water. Experiments show that lithium is the best reducing agent in water, so we might expect lithium to react most violently with water. However, it does not. Sodium and potassium react much more vigorously. Why? The answer lies in the relatively high melting point for lithium. When sodium and potassium react with water, the heat evolved causes them to melt, giving a larger area of contact with water. Lithium, on the other hand, does not melt under these conditions and thus reacts more slowly. This example illustrates the important principle (which we will discuss in detail in Chapter 15) that the energy of a reaction and the rate at which it occurs are not necessarily related. <br> In this section we have seen that the trends in atomic properties summarized by the periodic table can be a great help in understanding the chemical behavior of the elements. This fact will be emphasized over and over as we proceed in our study of chemistry.</p>

<p>La <i>saponificazione</i> è la reazione tra una base alcalina forte e uno o più acidi deboli, che dà come risultato un sale. A seconda che si sia usato idrossido di sodio (NaOH) o idrossido di potassio (KOH) come base alcalina, il sapone sarà infatti un sale sodico o potassico degli acidi grassi. I sali sodici danno origine a composti solidi (saponi da bucato, saponette), mentre i <i>sali potassici</i> in diverse proporzioni e con consistenze variabili a seconda dell'equilibriu degli alcali.</p>

<p>Sodium and potassium are, respectively, the sixth and eighth most abundant elements in the earth’s crust by mass. In contrast, lithium is relatively rare, as are rubidium and cesium. Only traces of radioactive francium occur in nature. Its longest lived isotope (<sup>223</sup>Fr) has a half-life of only 22 minutes. The Group 1A elements are metals, and all are highly reactive with oxygen, water, and other oxidizing agents. In all cases, compounds of the Group 1A metals contain the element as a 1+ ion. The free metal is never found in nature. Most sodium and potassium compounds are water-soluble, so it is not surprising that sodium and potassium compounds are found either in the oceans or in underground deposits that are the residue of ancient seas. To a much smaller extent, these elements are also found in minerals, such as Chile saltpeter (NaNO<sub>3</sub>). Despite the fact that sodium is only slightly more abundant than potassium on the earth, sea water contains significantly more sodium than potassium (2.8% NaCl versus 0.8% KCl). Why the great difference? Most compounds of both elements are water-soluble, so why didn’t rain dissolve Na and K containing minerals over the centuries and carry them down to the sea, so that they appear in the same proportions in the oceans as on land? The answer lies in the fact that potassium is an important factor in plant growth. Most plants contain four to six times as much combined potassium as sodium. Thus, most of the potassium ions in groundwater from dissolved minerals are taken up preferentially by plants, whereas sodium salts continue on to the oceans. (Because plants require potassium, commercial fertilizers usually contain a significant amount of potassium salts.) Some NaCl is essential in the diet of humans and other animals because many biological functions are controlled by the concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup> ions. The fact that salt has long been recognized as important is evident in surprising ways. For example, we are paid a “salary” for work done. This word is derived from the Latin salarium, which meant “salt money” because Roman soldiers were paid in salt.</p>

<h2>Preparation of Sodium and Potassium</h2>

<p>Sodium is produced by reducing sodium ions in sodium salts. However, because common chemical reducing agents are not powerful enough to convert sodium ions to sodium metal, the metal is usually prepared by electrolysis. The English chemist Sir Humphry Davy first isolated sodium in 1807 by the electrolysis of molten sodium carbonate. However, the element remained a laboratory curiosity until 1824, when it was found sodium could be used to reduce aluminum chloride to aluminum metal. At that time, metallic aluminum was rare and very valuable, so this discovery inspired considerable interest in manufacturing sodium. By 1886, a practical method of sodium production had been devised (the reduction of NaOH with carbon). Unfortunately for sodium producers, in this same year Charles Hall and Paul Heroult invented the electrolytic method for aluminum production, thereby eliminating this market for sodium. Sodium is currently produced by the <a href="electrolysis.html">electrolysis</a> of molten NaCl. The Downs cell for the electrolysis of molten NaCl operates at 7 to 8 V with currents of 25,000 to 40,000 amps (Figure 21.9). The cell is filled with a mixture of dry NaCl, CaCl 2 , and BaCl 2 . Adding other salts to NaCl lowers the melting point from that of pure NaCl (800.7 °C) to about 600 °C. [Recall that solutions have lower melting points than pure solvents (Chapter 14).] Sodium is produced at a copper or iron cathode that surrounds a circular graphite anode. Directly over the cathode is an inverted trough in which the low-density, molten sodium (melting point, 97.8 °C) collects. Chlorine, a valuable by-product, collects at the anode. Potassium can also be made by electrolysis. Molten potassium is soluble in molten KCl, however, making separation of the metal difficult. The preferred method for preparation of potassium uses the reaction of sodium vapor with molten KCl, with potassium being continually removed from the equilibrium mixture.</p>
