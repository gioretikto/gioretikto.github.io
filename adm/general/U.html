<h1>Uranium</h1>

<p>Uranium was discovered by Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who named it after the recently discovered planet <i>Uranus</i>. The uranium atom is the heaviest atom present in the natural environment. Its radioactivity is very low. Its very long life of several billion years has allowed uranium to be still present. It is a rare chemical element found in the Earth's crust with an average of 3 grams per tonne. All isotopes of uranium are unstable and radioactive, but uranium 238 and uranium 235 have half-lives which are sufficiently long to have allowed them to still be present in the Solar System and indeed on Earth. The <b>half-life</b> of uranium 238 is of <b>4.5 billion years</b>, while uranium 235 has a half-life of ‘only’ 700 million years. <br> Though both isotopes were at the time of Earth formation equally abundant, natural uranium today consists today of 99.3% uranium 238 and only 0.70% uranium 235. The nuclei of uranium 235 and 238 are, along with those of thorium 232, the heaviest present in nature. They were all formed billions of years ago by the explosion of heavy stars (supernovae). Uranium 235 is the only natural nucleus that can easily undergo <a href="nuclear_fission.html">fission</a>. Highly sought-after, it can be used as a fuel in nuclear reactors and as an explosive in atomic bombs.</p>

<p>The more abundant uranium 238 is sometimes called fertile. Fission occurs comparatively rarely, and even under bombardment with energetic neutrons the probability of fission remains very low. What happens more frequently is that a neutron capture causes the nucleus to become unstable. After a few days, uranium 239 has transformed into plutonium 239, a radioisotope with a half-life of 24,000 years. Plutonium 239 is highly fissile and can also be used as a nuclear fuel or an atomic explosive. Uranium reserves which exist under the oceans are about a thousand times more abundant than the reserves found in high quality minerals on land. Underwater uranium, however, would be extremely costly to exploit.</p>
