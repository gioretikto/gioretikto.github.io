<h1>Aluminum</h1>

<p>Aluminum is the most abundant of the metals and the third most abundant element, being exceeded in natural occurence only by oxygen and silicon. The metal and its hydroxide are amphoteric, As a result of its high charge, small diameter, and electron-pair deficiency, the Al (III) ion is incapable of independent existence in polar solvents. Due to the very high field strenghth surrounding this ion, complexation always takes place. <br> Many insoluble aluminum compounds find use as gastric antacids. </p>
