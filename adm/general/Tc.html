<h1>Technetium</h1>

<p>Technetium is an unusual element. Although a <i>d</i>-transition element (under manganese in Group VIIB) with a small atomic number (Z = 43), it has no stable isotopes. The nucleus of every technetium isotope is radioactive and decays, or disintegrates, to give an isotope of another element. Many of the technetium isotopes decay by emitting an electron from the nucleus.<br> Because of its nuclear instability, technetium is not found naturally on earth. Nevertheless, it is produced commercially in kilogram quantities from other elements by nuclear reactions, processes in which nuclei are transformed into different nuclei. Technetium (from the Greek <i>tekhnetos</i>, meaning “artificial”) was the first new element produced in the laboratory from another element. It was discovered in 1937 by Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segrè when the element molybdenum was bombarded with deuterons (nuclei of hydrogen, each having one proton and one neutron).</p>

<p>Technetium-99m is used in more than 85% of the diagnostic scans done in hospitals each year (see A Closer Look: Technetium-99m. The “m” stands for metastable, a term used to identify an unstable state that exists for a fi nite period of time. <br> Technetium-99m ​is ​formed​ when​ molybdenum-99​ decays​ by​ β emission.​ Technetium-99m​ then​ decays​ to​ its​ ground​ state​ with ​a​ half-life ​of ​6.01​ hours, ​giving​ off ​a ​140-KeV​ γ-ray​ in​ the​ process.​ (Technetium-99​ is​ itself ​unstable, ​decaying ​to ​stable​ <sup>99</sup>Ru​ with​ a​ half-life​ of ​2.1​×​10 <sup>5</sup> ​years.)</p>Technetium-99m ​is ​produced​ in​ hospitals​ using​ a ​molybdenum–technetium​ generator.​ Sheathed​ in​ lead​ shielding,​ the​ generator​ contains​ the​ artificially​ synthesized​ isotope​ 99Mo ​in ​the ​form ​of ​molybdate ​ion, ​MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>,​ adsorbed​ on ​a ​column ​of ​alumina,​ Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.​ The​ MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> ​is ​continually ​being​ converted​ into​ the ​pertechnate ​ion,​ <sup>99m</sup>TcO<sub>4</sub> − ​by​ β ​emission.​ When​ it​ is​ needed,​ the​ <sup>99m</sup>TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>​ is​ washed​ from​ the​ column​ using​ a​ saline​ solution.​ Technetium-99m​ may​ be ​used ​directly​ as ​the​ pertechnate​ ion​ or​ converted​ into​ other​ compounds.​ The​ pertechnate​ ion​ or​ radiopharmaceuticals​ made​ from​ it​ are​ administered​ intravenously​ to​ the​ patient.​ Such​ small​ quantities ​are ​needed ​that ​1​ μg ​(microgram)​ of​ technetium-99m​ is​ sufficient​ for​ the​ average ​hospital’s​daily imaging ​needs. One ​use​ of​ 99m Tc ​is ​for​ imaging​ the​ thyroid​ gland.​ Technetium-99m ​concentrates ​in ​sites ​of ​high ​activity. Because​ I<sup>−</sup> (aq)​ and​ TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup> (aq)​ ions​ have ​very​ similar ​sizes,​ the​ thyroid​ will​ (mistakenly)​ take ​up​ TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup> (aq) ​along ​with ​iodide​ ion.​ This​ uptake​ concentrates​ <sup>99m</sup>Tc​ in​ the​ thyroid​ and​ allows​ a​ physician​ to​ obtain​ an image of an organ.</p>

<p>Later, technetium was found to be a product of the fission, of uranium nuclei. <br> Technetium is one of the principal isotopes used in medical diagnostics obtained using an excited form of based on radioactivity. A compound of technetium is injected into a vein, where it technetium-99 concentrates in certain body organs. The energy emitted by technetium nuclei is detected by special equipment and gives an image of these body organs. Gamma rays emitted by technetium were detected by special equipment to produce images. The technetium is eliminated by the body after several hours.</p>
