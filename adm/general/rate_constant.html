<h1>Dependence of Rate on Concentration</h1>

<p>Experimentally, it has been found that a reaction rate depends on the concentrations of certain reactants as well as the concentration of catalyst, if there is one. Consider the reaction of nitrogen dioxide with fluorine to give nitryl fluoride, NO<sub>2</sub>F.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>2NO<sub>2</sub> (g) + F<sub>2</sub> (g) ⟶ 2NO<sub>2</sub>F(g)</p>
</div>

<p>The rate of this reaction is observed to be proportional to the concentration of nitrogen dioxide. When the concentration of nitrogen dioxide is doubled, the rate doubles. The rate is also proportional to the concentration of fluorine; doubling the concentration of fluorine also doubles the rate.<br>A <b>rate law</b> is an equation that relates the rate of a reaction to the concentrations of reactants (and catalyst) raised to various powers. The following equation is the rate law for the foregoing reaction:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) = Rate = <i>k</i>[NO<sub>2</sub>][F<sub>2</sub>]</p>
</div>

<p>Here <i>k</i>, called the <b>rate constant</b>, is a proportionality constant in the relationship between rate and concentrations. Note that the exponents in the equation Rate = k[NO<sub>2</sub>][F<sub>2</sub>] are both 1 and have no relationship to the coefficients in the balanced equation 2NO<sub>2</sub> + F<sub>2</sub> ⟶ 2NO<sub>2</sub>F. The constant <i>k</i> has a fixed value at any given temperature, but it varies with temperature. Whereas the units of rate are usually given as mol/(L⋅s), the units of <i>k</i> depend on the form of the rate law. For the previous rate law,</p>

 <div class="eq">
<p><i>k</i> = rate /[NO<sub>2</sub>][F<sub>2</sub>]</p>
</div>

<p>from which you get the following unit for <i>k</i>:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>mol/(L⋅s) / (mol/L)<sup>2</sup> = L/(mol ⋅ s)</p>
</div>

<p>As a more general example, consider the reaction of substances A and B to give D and E, according to the balanced equation</p>

<table class="noborder centertable">
<tr><td>aA</td> <td>+</td> <td>bB</td> <td>C<br> ⟶</td> <td>dD</td> <td>+</td> <td>eE</td> <td>&emsp;C = catalyst</td></tr>
</table>

<p>You could write the rate law in the form</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>k</i>[A]<sup>m</sup> [B]<sup>n</sup> [C]<sup>p</sup></p>
</div>

<p>The exponents <i>m, n</i>, and <i>p</i> are frequently, but not always, integers. They <i>must be determined experimentally</i> and they cannot be obtained simply by looking at the balanced equation. For example, note that the exponents in the equation Rate = <i>k</i>[NO<sub>2</sub>][F<sub>2</sub>] have no relationship to the coefficients in the balanced equation 2NO<sub>2</sub> + F<sub>2</sub> ⟶ 2NO<sub>2</sub>F. Although reaction orders frequently have whole-number values (particularly 1 or 2), they can be fractional. Zero and negative orders are also possible. Once you know the rate law for a reaction and have found the value of the rate constant, you can calculate the rate of a reaction for any values of reactant concentrations. As you will see later, knowledge of the rate law is also useful in understanding how the reaction occurs at the molecular level.</p>

<h2>Reaction Order</h2>

<p>You can classify a reaction by its orders. The <b>reaction order</b> with respect to a given reactant species equals the <i>exponent of the concentration of that species in the rate law, as determined experimentally</i>. For the reaction of NO<sub>2</sub> with F<sub>2</sub> to give NO<sub>2</sub>F, the reaction is first order with respect to the NO<sub>2</sub> because the exponent of [NO<sub>2</sub>] in the rate law is 1. Similarly, the reaction is first order with respect to F<sub>2</sub>. <br>The <b>overall order of a reaction</b> equals the sum of the orders of the reactant species in the rate law. In this example, the overall order is 2; that is, the reaction is second order overall.<br> Reactions display a variety of reaction orders. Some examples follow:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Consider, for example, the reaction of NO and Cl<sub>2</sub>:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>2NO(g) ​+ ​Cl<sub>2</sub>(g) → 2NOCl(g)</p>
</div>

<p>The experimentally determined rate equation for this reaction is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) ​= <i>k</i> [NO]<sup>2</sup>[Cl<sub>2</sub>]</p>
</div>

<p>This reaction is second order in NO, first order in Cl<sub>2</sub>, and third order overall.</p></li>

<li><p>Cyclopropane, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. When heated, the carbon ring (the triangle) opens up to give propylene, CH<sub>2</sub>=CHCH<sub>3</sub>. Because the compounds are isomers (different compounds with the same molecular formula), the reaction is called an <i>isomerization</i>.</p>

<table class="noborder centertable">
<tr><td>C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>(g)<br>Cyclopropane</td> <td>⟶</td> <td>CH<sub>2</sub>=CHCH<sub>3</sub>(g) <br>Propylene</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The reaction has the experimentally determined rate law</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>k</i>[C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>]</p>
</div>

</li>

<li><p>Nitrogen monoxide, NO, reacts with hydrogen according to the equation</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>2NO(g) + 2H<sub>2</sub> (g) ⟶ N<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(g)</p>
</div>

<p>The experimentally determined rate law is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>k</i>[NO]<sup>2</sup>[H<sub>2</sub>]</p>
</div>

<p>Thus, the reaction is second order in NO, first order in H<sub>2</sub>, and third order overall.</p>

<li><p>Acetone, CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>, reacts with iodine in acidic solution.</p>

<table class="noborder centertable">
<tr><td>CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub> (aq) + I<sub>2</sub>(aq)</td> <td>H<sup>+</sup><br>⟶</td> <td>CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>2</sub>I (aq) + HI(aq)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The experimentally determined rate law is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>k</i>[CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>][H<sup>+</sup>]</p>
</div>

<p>The reaction is first order in acetone. It is zero order in iodine; that is, the rate law contains the factor [I<sub>2</sub>]<sup>0</sup> = 1. Therefore, the rate does not depend on the concentration of I<sub>2</sub>, as long as some concentration of I<sub>2</sub> is present. Note that the reaction is first order in the catalyst, H<sup>+</sup>. Thus, the overall order is 2.</p></li>
