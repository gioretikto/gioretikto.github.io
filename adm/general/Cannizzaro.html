<h1>Cannizzaro’s Interpretation</h1>



<p>Convinced that chemists had to find a way to agree on a common set of atomic masses, the German chemist F. August Kekulé organized the First International Chemical Congress held in 1860 at Karlsruhe, Germany. At this meeting the young Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro presented his ideas so clearly and forcefully, both in formal and informal talks, that a consensus about atomic masses began to develop in the chemical community. Cannizzaro was guided by two main beliefs:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Compounds contained whole numbers of atoms as Dalton postulated.</p></li>
	<li><p>Avogadro’s hypothesis was correct—equal volumes of gases under the same conditions contain the same number of molecules.</p></li>
	<li><p>The existence of biatomic molecules.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Nella <i>Lezione sulla teoria atomica</i>, tenuta a Genova nel 1858, a proposito delfatto che la “mezza molecola” di idrogeno era la quantità minima di questo elementoche si ritrovava in tutti i composti idrogenati, egli affermava:</p>

<blockquote>“Diamo a questa minima quantit`a il nome di atomo; per ci`o diciamo essere lamolecola dell’idrogeno composta di due atomi. Nel dir ciò noi non asseveriamoche ciascun di questi atomi non contenga parti distinte, ma non vogliamo altroesprimere che il seguente fatto: ciascuno di questi atomi non si subdivide maiin quella sfera di azioni chimiche che siamo giunti a produrre; potrebbe darsiche, estendendo i nostri mezzi analitici, giungeremo a scoprire una ulterioredivisione della mezza molecola di idrogeno.”</blockquote>

<p>Applications of Avogadro’s hypothesis to Gay-Lussac’s results of combining volumes of gas convinced Cannizzaro that hydrogen gas consisted of H<sub>2</sub> molecules. Thus he arbitrarily assigned the relative molecular mass of hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) to be 2. He then set out to measure the relative molecular masses for other gaseous substances. He did so by comparing the mass of 1 liter of a given
gas with the mass of 1 liter of hydrogen gas (both gases at the same conditions of temperature and pressure). For example, the ratio of the masses of 1-liter samples of oxygen and hydrogen gas is 16:</p>

  </mfrac>
  <mo>=</mo>
  <mfrac>
    <mn>32</mn>
    <mn>2</mn>
  </mfrac>
</math>

<!-- $$ \frac{\text{Mass of 1.0 L oxygen gas}}{\text{Mass of 1.01 L hydrogen gas}} = \frac{16}{1} = \frac{32}{2} $$ -->

<p>Since by Avogadro’s hypothesis both samples of gas contain the same number of molecules, the mass of an oxygen molecule (which he assumed to be O<sub>2</sub>) must be 32 relative to a mass of 2 for the H 2 molecule. Since each molecule contains two atoms, the relative atomic masses for oxygen and hydrogen are then 16 and 1, respectively. Using this same method, Cannizzaro found the relative molecular mass of carbon dioxide to be 44 (relative to 2 for H<sub>2</sub>). Chemical analysis of carbon dioxide had shown it to contain 27% carbon (by mass). This percentage corresponds to (0.27)(44 g), or 12 g, of carbon in
44 g of carbon dioxide, and 44 g − 12 g = 32 g of oxygen. Recall that the oxy- gen atom has a relative mass of 16. Thus if the formula of carbon dioxide is assumed to be CO<sub>2</sub>, then the relative mass of carbon is 12 because 12 1 2(16) 5 44. However, if the formula of carbon dioxide is C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, then 12 represents the relative mass of two carbon atoms, giving carbon a relative mass of 6. Similarly, the formula C<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for carbon dioxide gives a relative mass of 4 for carbon. Thus the relative mass of the carbon atom cannot be determined from these data without knowing the formula for carbon dioxide. This is exactly the type of problem that had plagued chemists all along and was the reason for so many different mass tables.<br> Cannizzaro addressed this problem by obtaining the relative molecular masses of many other compounds containing carbon. For example, consider the data shown in Table 2.1. Notice from these data that the relative mass of carbon present in the compounds is always a multiple of 12. This observation strongly suggests that the relative mass of carbon is 12, which in turn would mean that the formula for carbon dioxide is CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Cannizzaro’s work was so convincing because he collected data on so many compounds. Although he couldn’t absolutely prove that his atomic mass values were correct (because he had no way to verify absolutely the formulas of the compounds), the consistency of the large quantity of data he had collected eventually convinced virtually everyone that his interpretation made sense and that the relative values of atomic mass that he had determined were correct. The confusion was finally over. Chemistry had the universal (relative) mass standards that it needed. <br>  It is worthwhile to note that Cannizzaro’s work led to approximate values of the relative atomic masses. His goal was not to determine highly precise values for atomic masses but rather to pin down the <i>approximate</i> values (for
example, to show that oxygen’s relative mass was 16 rather than 8). The most precise values for atomic masses were determined by quantitative experiments in which the combining masses of elements were carefully measured, such as in the work of Berzelius. <br> In the next chapter we will have much more to say about atomic masses, including the origin of the very precise values used by today’s chemists.</p>
