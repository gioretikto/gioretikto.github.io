<h1>Oxygen</h1>

<p><b>Appearance</b> gas: colorless; liquid and solid: pale blue.<br>
<b>Melting point</b> 54.36 K ​(−218.79 °C)<br>
<b>Boiling point</b> 90.188 K ​(−182.962 °C)</p>

<p>It is hard to overstate the importance of oxygen, the most abundant element in and near the earth’s crust. Oxygen is present in the atmosphere as oxygen gas and ozone; in soil and rocks in oxide, silicate, and carbonate minerals; in the oceans in water; and in our bodies in water and a myriad of other molecules. In addition, most of the energy we need to live and run our civilization comes from the exothermic reactions of oxygen with ­carbon-containing molecules. <br> The most common elemental form of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) constitutes 21% of the volume of the earth’s atmosphere. Since nitrogen has a lower boiling point than oxygen, nitrogen can be boiled away from liquid air, leaving oxygen and small amounts of argon, another component of air. Liquid oxygen is a pale blue liquid that freezes at −219 °C and boils at −183°C. The paramagnetism of the O<sub>2</sub> molecule can be demonstrated by pouring liquid oxygen between the poles of a strong magnet, where it “sticks” until it boils away (see Fig. 4‐51). The paramagnetism of the O<sub>2</sub> molecule can be accounted for by the molecular orbital model (Fig. 4‐50), which also explains its bond strength. </p>

<h2>How Oxygen was discovered?</h2>

<p>Two hundred or so years ago, most scientist had different ideas about the air and fire. They thought air was just a single gas. They explained fire by the "phlogiston" theory. This was the idea that when anything burned, a special fire substance called phlogiston was involved. <br> In the 1770s, a number of chemists began to conduct experiments that were to overtyrn this theory. In 1773, Swedish chemist Carl Scheele (1742 - 1786) discovered that nitric acid released a gas when heated. Scheele named this gas "fire air" because it burned brightly. <br> A year later, Englishman <b>Joseph Priestly</b> (1733 - 1804), probably unaware of Scheele's work, also found the gas by heating mercuric oxide. Priestly saw that it made a candle burn brillantrly. He wrote that "two mice and myself have had the privilege of breathing this air". Late Priestly demonstrated that this gas was given off by plants and that animals died without it. <br> Yet it was French scientis Antoine Lavoisier who realized the real significance of the gas and showed that it is one of the two main constituents of air. Lavoisier repeated Priestly's experiments. In 1772, Lavoisier had been among the first to make precise weight measurements to quantify how musch "air" disappeared during combustion of phosphorous and sulfur. Lavoisier discovered that when phosphorous or sulfur is burned in air, the products are acidic in nature, and the products also weigh more than the original phosphorus or sulfur, and the came to the conclusion that the elements combine with something in the air to produce acids, but he could not recognize what was in the air that combined with phosphorus or sulfur. In October 1774, he met Joseph Priestly during his visit to Paris; he told Lavoisier about the gas produces when he decomposed the compound which we now call mercury oxide. This gas supported combustion much more powerfully than normal air. Priestly belived the gas was a particularly pure version of air; he started calling it dephlogisticaed air, believing its unusual properties were caused by the absence of phlogiston. In 1779, Lavoisier coined the name oxygen (from the Greek words <i>oxys</i> meaning "acid" and <i>genos</i> meaning "forming") for the element released by decomposition of mercury oxide, and form here, explanation of certain reactions as oxidation reduction officially started, and could state</p>

<blockquote>the substance which combines with metals during calcination, thereby increasing their weight is nothing else than the pure portion of the air which surrounds us and which we breathe."</blockquote>

<h3 id="O3">Ozone</h3>

<p>In 1785, it was noted by Van Marum that when an electric spark is passed through oxygen an unusual odor results. The odor is caused by <b>ozone</b>, O<sub>3</sub> which has a characteristic pungent smell. In fact, ozono can be detected ar very low levels by its intense odor, and the Gree <i>ozein</i>, meaning to smell is the origin of the name ozone. Van Marum  also noted that the gas reacted with mercury, and in 1840 Schönbein noted that the gas reacted with potassium iodide solution to liberate iodine. Ozone (m.p. −193 °C and b.p. −112 °C) has a heat of formation of +146 kj mol<sup>−1</sup> so it is unstable with respect to O<sub>2</sub>. Mixtures of ozone and oxygen are explosive. It is another form of elemental oxygen, a molecule that can be represented by the resonance structures</p>

<p>In certi casi un atomo di ossigeno può legarsi ad un altro atomo uguale con un legame covalente omeopolare (–O–O–), pertanto gli elettroni di tale legame non contano ai fini del computo del numero di ossidazione, in quanto i due elettroni sono equamente ripartiti al 50% fra i due atomi). Come risultato il numero di ossidazione dell'ossigeno diventa in questo caso –1 anziché –2 e i composti contenenti tale legame omeopolare vengono chiamati <b>perossidi</b>. Esempi:</p>

<p>Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = perossido di sodio<br>
BaO<sub>2</sub> = perossido di bario<br>
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = perossido d'idrogeno, acqua ossigenata</p>
</div>

<p>The bent O<sub>3</sub> molecule has infrared absorptions at 1103 cm<sup>−1</sup> (symmetric stretch), 701 cm<sup>−1</sup> (bending), and 1042 cm<sup>−1</sup> (asymmetric stretch). <br> The ozone molecule has a dipole moment of 0.534 D, which is largely due to the unshared pair of electrons on the central atom. With its heat of formation being þ143 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>, ozone is unstable with respect to oxygen. It can decompose explosively in the presence of catalysts or ultraviolet radiation. Several substances catalyze the decomposition including Na<sub>2</sub>O, K<sub>2</sub>O, MgO, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Cl<sub>2</sub>. The real value of ozone lies in the fact that in the upper atmosphere it absorbs ultraviolet radiation. The maximum in the absorption band is at 255 nm. It is believed that chlorofluorocarbons used as a refrigerating gas and as a propellant for aerosols are contributing to a reduction in the ozone layer. This has been the subject of much research and discussion and has led to discontinuing the widespread use of chlorofluorocarbons. For laboratory use, ozone is normally produced at the time and location of use by means of an ozonizer. This device bombards oxygen with low frequency electrical oscillation (so-called silent electric discharge) in a flow system. The effluent gas contains several percent O<sub>3</sub>, which is usually passed directly into the reaction vessel. The reaction can be shown as</p>

<table class="noborder centertable">
<tr><td>3O<sub>2</sub></td> <td>electric<br>⟶<br>discharge</td> <td>2O<sub>3</sub></td></tr>

<p>The ozone molecule can accept an electron to produce an ozonide, O<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>. One of the most common stable ozonides is KO<sub>3</sub>, which is a powerful and useful oxidizing agent. It is stable at temperatures below 60°C, but it reacts with water,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>4 KO<sub>3</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub> ⟶ 4 KOH + 5O<sub>2</sub></p>
</div>

<p>Ozone itself is a useful and strong oxidizing agent that is comparable in strength to fluorine and atomic oxygen. It is particularly useful in situations where a “clean” oxidizing agent is needed because the reduction product is only oxygen. Water purification is such a situation, and ozone is an effective germicide. It will also oxidize some toxic materials to less harmful forms. For example, it reacts with cyanides, cyanates, and other anions. The reaction with cyanate can be shown as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>2 OCN<sup>−</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O + 3 O<sub>3</sub> ⟶ 2HCO<sup>−</sup> + 3O<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub></p>
</div>

<p>Ozone can also be used to transform metals into their highest oxidation states, which is often desirable when separation is desired.</p>

<p>Ozone is a useful oxidizing agent in organic reactions especially when double bonds are involved. In the <a href="../organic/alkense_ox.html">Ozonolysis</a> of an alkene, The product of such a reaction is known as an ozonide, and the general reaction can be shown as</p>
