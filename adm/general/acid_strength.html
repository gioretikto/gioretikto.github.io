<h1>The Structural Basis for Acid Strength</h1>

<h2>Hydrogen Halides</h2>

<p>The hydrogen halides can be prepared by a reaction of the elements</p>

<table class="noborder">
<tr><td>H<sub>2</sub> (g)</td> <td>+</td> <td>X<sub>2</sub> (g)</td>⟶</td> <td>2HX (g)</td></tr>

<p>This reaction occurs with explosive vigor when fluorine and hydrogen are mixed. On the other hand, hydrogen and chlorine can coexist with little apparent reaction for relatively long periods in the dark. However, ultraviolet light causes an explosively fast reaction, and this is the basis of a popular lecture demonstration, the “hydrogen–chlorine cannon.” Bromine and iodine also react with hydrogen, but more slowly.<br> Some physical properties of the hydrogen halides are listed in Table 19‑19. Note the very high boiling point for hydrogen fluoride, which results from extensive hydrogen bonding among the very polar HF molecules. Fluoride ion has such a high ­affinity for protons that in concentrated aqueous solutions of hydrogen fluoride, the ion [F---H---F]<sup>−</sup> exists, in which an H<sup>+</sup> ion is centered between two F<sup>−</sup> ions. </p>

<p>HF is a stronger acid than H<sub>2</sub>O, which, though it is not binary, having two H−O bonds.</p>

<table class="noborder">
<tr><td>HF (aq)</td> <td>⇌</td> <td>H<sup>+</sup>(aq)</td> <td>+ F<sup>−</sup> (aq)</td> <td>K<sub>a</sub> = 7.2 x 10<sup>−4</sup></td></tr>
<tr><td>H<sub>2</sub>O (l)</td> <td>⇌</td> <td>H<sup>+</sup>(aq)</td> <td>+</td> <td>OH<sup>−</sup> (aq)</td> <td>K<sub>w</sub> = 1.0 x 10<sup>−14</sup></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Thus HF is a much stronger acid than water and we assume that hydrofluoric acid will be the dominant source of H<sup>+</sup>, in aqueous solutions. We will ignore the tiny contribution by water.</p>

<h2>What Does make fluoride a weak acid?</h2>

<p>Recall that acid strenght is reflected by the magnitude of K<sub>a</sub> −− a small value of K<sub>a</sub> means a weak acid. Also an equilibrium constant is related to the standard free energy change for the reaction,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&Delta;<i>G</i>° = − <i>RT</i> ln(<i>K<sub>a</sub></i>)</p>
</div>

<p>As &Delta;<i>G</i>° becomes more negative, <i>K<sub>a</sub></i> becomes larger, a <i>decrease</i> is free energy favors a given reaction. As we know free energy depends on enthalpy, entropy and temperature. For a process at constant temperature</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&Delta;<i>G</i>° = &Delta;<i>H</i>° − T&Delta;<i>S</i>°</p>
</div>

<p>What energy terms are important in determining &Delta;<i>H</i>°? Surely the H−X bond strenght. For binary acids such as Hydrohalic acids: HCl, HBr, HI and HF, acid strength increases as the H-X bond strength decreases and as the stability of the conjugate base (X<sup>−</sup> increases) HF &lt; HCl &lt; HBr &lt; HI. The <i>higher electron density</i> results in stronger bonds between the electronegative atom and hydrogen, which makes these weaker acids. HF results a weaker acid than HCl: (F<sup>−</sup>) is very unhappy and unstable with a single negative charge spread across its small radius. However, if the sizes of the atoms bonded to hydrogen are about the same, the acidity increases with increasing electronegativity of the atom bonded to hydrogen, because the polarity of the bond also increases. </p>

<p>When dissolved in water, the hydrogen halides behave as acids, and all except hydrogen fluoride are completely dissociated. Because water is a much stronger base than the Cl<sub>2</sub>, Br<sub>2</sub>, or I<sub>2</sub> ion, the acid strengths of HCl, HBr, and HI cannot be differentiated in water. However, in a less basic solvent, such as glacial (pure) acetic acid, the acids show different strengths:</p>

<table class="noborder">

<tr><td>Weakest acid</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>Strongest acid</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Another important contribution to &Delta;<i>H</i>° is the enthalpy of hydration of X<sup>−</sup>. As we would expect the smalles of the halide ions F<sup>–</sup>, has the most negative value −its hydration  is the most exothermic. This term favors the dissociation of HF into its ions more so than it does for the other HX molecules.</p>

<p>So far we have two conflicting factors: The large HF bond energy tends to make HF a weaker acid than the other hydrogen halides, but the enthalpy of hydration favors the dissociation of HF more than that of the others. When we compare data for HF and HCl, the difference in bond energy (138 kJ/mol) is slightly smaller than the difference in the enthalpies of hydration for the anions (144 kJ/mol). If these were the only important factors, HF should be a stronger acid than HCl because the large enthalpy of hydration of F more than compensates for the large HF bond strength.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the <b>deciding factor appears to be entropy</b>. Note from the Table below that the entropy of hydration for F<sup>−</sup> is much more negative than the entropy of hydration for the other halides because of the high degree of ordering that occurs as the water molecules associate with the small F ion. Remember that a negative change in entropy is unfavorable. When H<sub>2</sub>O molecules cluster around an ion, an ordering effect occurs; thus &Delta;S°<sub>hyd</sub> is negative. Thus, although the enthalpy of hydration favors dissociation of HF, the entropy of hydration strongly opposes it. When all these factors are taken into account, &Delta;<i>G</i>° for the dissociation of HF in water is positive; that is, K<sub>a</sub> is small. In contrast, &Delta;<i>G</i>° for dissociation of the other HX molecules in water is negative (<i>K<sub>a</sub></i> is large).</p>

<p>Entropy decreases dramatically when the hydrogen fluoride reacts with water. This is particularly noticeable with hydrogen fluoride because the attraction of the small fluoride ions produced imposes significant order on the surrounding water molecules and nearby hydronium ions. The effect decreases with larger halide ions.</p>

<p>H<sub>2</sub>Se, H<sub>2</sub>S; H<sub>2</sub>Se is the stronger acid because Se is larger than S. Thus, the H–Se bond is weaker than the H–S bond and HSe<sup>–</sup> is more stable than HS<sup>–</sup>.</p>

<p>H<sub>2</sub>S, is a stronger acid than water, even though oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur. H–S bond is more easily broken that the H–O bond.</p>

<h2>Estimation of acid and base strengths from a molecule’s structure</h2>

<p>The relationship between structure and function is very evident in acid-base chemistry. Indeed, three structural features allow us to estimate, at least qualitatively, the relative strength of an acid HA (and hence the weakness of its conjugate base):</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>The increasing electronegativity of A as we proceed from left to right across a row in the periodic table. The more electronegative the atom to which the acidic proton is attached, the more polar the bond, and the more acidic the proton will be. For example, the increasing order of acidity in the series H<sub>4</sub> C &lt; H<sub>3</sub>N &lt; H<sub>2</sub>O &lt; HF parallels the increasing electronegativity of A. Furthermode electronegative elements can more easily bear a negative charge than less electronegative ones, and so their attached protons will be more acidic.</p></li>
	
	<li><p>The increasing size of A as we proceed down a column in the periodic table. The acid strengths of the hydrogen halides increase in the order HF &lt; HCl &lt; HBr &lt; HI. Dissociation to give H<sup>+</sup> and A<sup>–</sup> is favored for larger A, because the overlap of its largerouter-shell orbital with the 1s hydrogen orbital is poor, weakening the H – A bond. In addition, the larger outer-shell orbitals permit the electrons to occupy a larger volume of space, thus reducing electron – electron repulsion in the resulting anion.</p>

	<p>The bond-strength argument is often the only reason given for the acidity order in the hydrogen halides: HF possesses the strongest bond, HI the weakest. However, this correlation fails for the series H<sub>4</sub>C, H<sub>3</sub>N, H<sub>2</sub>O, HF, in which the weakest acid, CH<sub>4</sub>, also has the weakest H–A bond.</p></li>
	
	<li><p>The <a href="../general/resonance.html">resonance</a> in A<sup>−</sup> that allows delocalization of charge over several atoms. This effect is frequently enhanced by the presence of additional electronegative atoms in A<sup>−</sup>. For example, acetic acid is more acidic than methanol. In both cases, an O–H bond dissociates into ions. Methoxide, the conjugate base of methanol, possesses a localized negative charge on oxygen. In contrast, the acetate ion has two resonance forms and is able to delocalize its charge onto a second oxygen atom. Thus in the acetate ion the negative charge is better accommodated, stabilizing acetate and making it the weaker base.</p>
	
	<p>Acetic Acid Is Stronger than Methanol because Acetate is Stabilized by Resonance:</p>
	
	<table class="noborder">
	<tr><td>CH<sub>3</sub>O−H</td> <td>+</td> <td>H<sub>2</sub>O</td> <td>⇌</td> <td>CH<sub>3</sub>−O<sup>−</sup></td> <td>+</td> <td>H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup></td></tr>
	<tr><td>weaker acid</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>Stronger base</td></tr>

		<tr><td>stronger acid</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>weaker base</td></tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>Even more pronounced is the effect of resonance in sulfuric acid. The availability of <i>d</i> orbitals on sulfur enables us to write valence-shell-expanded Lewis structures containing as many as 12 electrons. Alternatively, charge-separated structures with one or two positive charges on sulfur can be used. Both representations indicate that the pK<sub>a</sub> of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> should be low.</p>	
	
	</li>
</ol>
	
<p>Consider a “generic” oxygen-containing compound with a central atom, A. If A has a high electronegativity, then it will have a tendency to form a covalent bond with oxygen, which is also highly electronegative, while weakening the bond between the oxygen and hydrogen. The hydrogen can then be easily removed, which means the compound is acidic. The more electronegative the central atom (A), the more acidic the compound. Chlorine is more electronegative than sulfur, which, in turn, is more electronegative than phosphorus. This means that perchloric acid (HClO<sub>4</sub>) is inherently stronger than sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), which is stronger than phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>). We do not see the difference between perchloric and sulfuric acids in aqueous solution, but phosphoric acid is noticeably weaker in water than either of these other compounds.</p>

<p>For the same central atom (sulfur, for example), the higher the oxidation state, the higher the attraction for electrons and the stronger the covalent bond between the sulfur and oxygen atom. This tends to weaken the O—H bond in these compounds, as described above. This is why H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (with sulfur in the +6 oxidation state) is a stronger acid than H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> (where sulfur is in the +4 oxidation state). For the same reason, HNO<sub>3</sub>; is stronger than HNO<sub>2</sub>), and the strength of so-called chlorine “oxoacids” is HClO<sub>4</sub> &gt; HClO<sub>3</sub> &gt; HClO<sub>2</sub> &gt; HClO.</p>

<p>This model explains why a compound such as NaOH is basic. Let’s look again at Figure 17.10, where “A” is Na. Sodium has a relatively low electronegativity and therefore will not form a strong covalent bond with the oxygen atom. The bond between the oxygen and hydrogen is stronger and will remain intact. The hydrogen ion is therefore readily released to the solution, making NaOH strong base in water.</p>

<h3>Superacids</h3>

<p>It is possible to make acids that are amazingly strong by the addition of very electronegative groups to the central atom. For example, HSO<sub>3</sub>F, is one of several superacids that can be used to add hydrogen to organic molecules that are otherwise impervious to such reaction. Other superacids include HSO<sub>3</sub>CF<sub>3</sub> and the recently synthesized HCB<sub>11</sub>H<sub>6</sub>X<sub>6</sub>, where X = Cl or Br.</p>
