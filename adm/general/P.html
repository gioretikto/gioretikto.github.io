<h1>Phosphorus</h1>

<p>Elemental phosphorus was first derived from human waste. In 1699, The ​German​al alchemist ​Hennig ​Brand​, was​ in​ search​ of​ the​ philosopher’s​ stone,​ the​ magic​ elixir​ that​ would​ turn​ the ​crudest ​substance ​into ​gold.​ Brandt​ was​ experimenting​ with​ urine,​ which​ had​ served​ as​ the​ source​ of​ useful​ chemicals ​since ​Roman ​times.​ It​ is ​not ​surprising ​that ​phosphorus ​could ​be ​extracted​ from​ this​ source.​ Humans​ consume​ much​ more ​phosphorus, ​in ​the​ form​ of​ phosphate,​ than​ they ​require, ​and​ the​excess​ phosphorus​ (about​ 1.4​ g​ per​ day)​ is​ excreted​ in​ the​ urine.​ Brandt heated dried urine with sand and when it passed the resulting vapors through water, the was able to isolate the form of elemental phoshorous known as <i>white phosphorus</i> (contains P<sub>4</sub> molecules). The name phosphorus us derived from the Latin <i>phos</i>, meaning light, and <i>phorus</i>, meaning bearing. It seems that when Brand stored the solid white phosphorus in a sealed bottle, it glowed in the dark. This effect, a glow that persists even after the light source has been removed came to be called <i>phosphorescence</i>. Interestingly, the term phosphorescence is derived from the name of an element that really does not phosphorescence. The glow that Brand saw actually was the result of a reaction of oxygen from the air on the surface of white phosphorus. If isolated completely from air, phosphorus does not glow in the dark after being irradiated.</p>

<p>It​ is​ nonetheless​ extraordinary​ that​ Brandt​ was​ able​ to​ isolate​ the​ element.​ According​ to​ an​ 18th-century​ chemistry​ book,​ about​ 30​ g​ of​ phosphorus​ could​ be​ obtained ​from ​60 ​gallons ​of ​urine. ​And ​the​ process​ was​ not​ simple.​ Another​ 18th-century​ recipe​ states​ that​ “50​ or​ 60​ pails​ full” ​of ​urine ​was ​to ​be ​used. ​“Let ​it ​lie​ steeping​.​.​.​till ​it ​putrefy​ and ​breed​worms. ”​The​ chemist ​was ​then ​to ​reduce ​the ​whole ​to ​a​ paste​ and​ finally​ to​ heat​ the​ paste​ very​ strongly​ in ​a ​retort.​ After​ some​days, ​phosphorus​ distilled​ from​ the​ mixture​ and​ was​ collected​ in ​water. ​(We​ know​ now ​that ​carbon​ from​ the​ organic​ compounds​ in​ the​ urine ​would ​have ​reduced ​the ​phosphate ​to​ phosphorus.)​ </p>

<h2>Allotropes of Phosphorus</h2>

<p>Phosphorus has two common allotropes: white phosphorus and red phosphorus.</p>

<img src="img/white_red_P.png" alt="white, red P"/>

<p>White phosphorus, a waxy, white solid, is very poisonous and very reactive. If white phosphorus is left exposed to air, it bursts spontaneously into flame. Because of its reactivity with oxygen, white phosphorus is stored under water, in which it is insoluble. As you might expect from its low melting point (44°C), white phosphorus is a molecular solid, with the formula P<sub>4</sub>, rather than N<sub>2</sub> as its second-period relative. The phosphorus atoms in the P<sub>4</sub> molecule are arranged at the corners of a regular tetrahedron such that each atom is single-bonded to the other three (Figure 21.47). The experimentally determined P−P−P bond angle is 60°. Because this is considerably smaller than the normal bond angle, the bonding in P<sub>4</sub> is strained and therefore weaker. This accounts for the reactivity seen in this phosphorus allotrope; chemical reactions of P<sub>4</sub> replace its weak bonds by stronger ones.</p>

<figcaption>White phosphorus, made up of tetrahedral P<sub>4</sub>. The reactivity of white phosphorus results from the small P−P−P angle (60°).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>White phosphorus was​ made​ using urine for ​more ​than ​100​ years. But it is now produced by the reduction of phosphate minerals in an electric furnace by heating phosphate rock with coke (C) and quartz sand (SiO<sub>2</sub>) in an electric furnace

<div class="eq">
<p>2 Ca<sub>3</sub> (PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (s) ​+  ​10 C(s) ​+ 6 SiO<sub>2</sub> (s) → P<sub>4</sub> (g) ​+  ​6 CaSiO<sub>3</sub> (s) ​+ ​10 CO(g)</p>
</div>

<p>The phosphorus vapor can then be cooled under water, preventing its spontaneous combustion, and eventually yielding the solid forms of phosphorus present at room temperature. The other product, calcium silicate glass (called slag), is drained periodically from the bottom of the furnace. The carbon monoxide gas is used as a fuel. Most of the white phosphorus produced is used to manufacture phosphoric acid, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. Some white phosphorus is converted to red phosphorus, which has a chain structure (Figure 21.48). Red phosphorus is much less reactive than white phosphorus and can be stored in the presence of air. This phosphorus allotrope is relatively nontoxic and is used in the striking surface for safety matches. Waxy white phosphorus is the most common allotrope of phosphorus, but paradoxically it is the least stable thermodynamically. <br>By heating up white phosphorus at 300 °C its allotropic form, red phosphorus is obtained. Red phosphorus is a polymer of P<sub>4</sub> units.</p>

<h3>Phosphorus Oxides</h3>

<p>Phosphorus has two common oxides, tetraphosphorus hexoxide, P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, and tetraphosphorus decoxide, P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>. Their common names are phosphorus trioxide and phosphorus pentoxide, respectively. The names are at odds with present rules of nomenclature but stem from their empirical formulas, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.<br> If P<sub>4</sub> is carefully oxidized, P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub> is formed; an O atom has been placed into each P—P bond in the tetrahedron. The most common and important phosphorus oxide is P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>, a fine white powder commonly called phosphorus pentaoxide because its empirical formula is P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. In P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>, each phosphorus atom is surrounded tetrahedrally by O atoms.</p>

<p>Phosphorus also forms a series of compounds with sulfur. Of these, the most important is P<sub>4</sub>S<sub>3</sub>. In this phosphorus sulfide, S atoms are placed into only three of the P&minus;P bonds. The principal use of P<sub>4</sub>S<sub>3</sub> is in “strike anywhere” matches, the kind that light when you rub the head against a rough object. The active ingredients are P<sub>4</sub>S<sub>3</sub> and the powerful oxidizing agent potassium chlorate, KClO<sub>3</sub>. The “safety match” is now more common than the “strike anywhere” match. In safety matches, the head is predominantly KClO<sub>3</sub>, and the material on the match book is red phosphorus (about 50%), Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and glue.</p>

<p>Enormous quantities of phosphorus compounds are used around the world, and most of this begins with phosphate rock, which is largely Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> or apatite. Phosphate rock is converted to impure phosphoric acid and then to other products, or to elemental phosphorus, from which pure acid and other products are made.</p>

<h2>Phosphoric acids</h2>

<p>There are three types of phosphoric acids, ortho, pyro and meta phosphoric acids and they are prepared by hydratation of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub></p>

<div class="eq">
<p>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → 2HPO<sub>3</sub> (metaphosphoric acid)<br>
P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O → 2H<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (pyrophosphoric acid)<br>
P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O → 2H<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (ortho phosphoric acid)<br>
</div>

<p>Ortho phosphoric acid is commonly known as phosphoric acid.</p>

<h3 id="PH3">PH<sub>3</sub>, Phosphine</h3>

<p>Phosphine, PH<sub>3</sub>, bp = −87.5 °C, mp = − 134 °C, <i>&rho;</i>= 1.529 g/L at 0°C, 760 mm.</p>

<p>Phosphide salts react vigorously with water to produce <i>phosphine</i> (PH<sub>3</sub>), a toxic, colorless gas:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>2Na<sub>3</sub>P (s) + 6H<sub>2</sub>O(l) ⟶ 2PH<sub>3</sub> (g) + 6Na<sup>+</sup> (aq) + 6OH<sub>2</sub> (aq)</p>
</div>

<p>Phosphine is analogous to ammonia, although it is a much weaker base (K<sub>b</sub> ≃ 10<sup>−26</sup>), which suggests that the lone pair on PH<sub>3</sub> is not available to interact with a proton fo form PH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. These observations can be explained assuming that hybridization is not occuring in PH<sub>3</sub>: the lone pair is in the 3<i>s</i> orbital, while the electron involved in forming the P−H bonds are simply those in the unhybridized 3<i>p</i> orbitals. In the case of N atom, the <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals are not too much larger that the hydrogen 1<i>s</i> orbital for the overlap to be effective in producing stronger bonds. For the large atoms, the <i>p</i> orbitals are already larger than the H 1<i>s</i> orbital and increasing their size by making <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> hybrid decreases the effectiveness of overlap. Therefore, stronger bonds form with the esentially unhybridized <i>p</i> orbital on the central atom and the bond angles are close to 90° (expected if P is using pure <i>p</i> orbitals); So PH<sub>3</sub> has a pyramidal molecular structure, as we would predict from the <a href="VSEPR.html">VSEPR model</a> but the xperimental measurements show that the H–P–H bond angle in phosphine is 93.8°, much closer to 90° than to a tetrahedral angle of 109.5°.</p>

<img src="img/PH3.png" alt="PH3"/>

<p>It is also much less soluble in water: H is slightly more electronegative than N. The absence of hydrogen bonding explains why PH<sub>3</sub> has a lower boiling point than ammonia inspite of the fact that it is a heavier molecule. It is a poisonous, highly reactive gas with a faint garlic-like odor. Industrially, it is made by the reaction of white phosphorus and aqueous NaOH.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>P<sub>4</sub>(s) ​+ ​3KOH (aq) ​+ ​3H<sub>2</sub>O(l) → PH<sub>3</sub>(g) ​+ ​3KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>(aq)</p>

<p>or by heating calcium phoshide with water</p>

<p>The gas is collected over water.</p>
