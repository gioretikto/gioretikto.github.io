<h1>Cobalt</h1>

<p>Cobalt is a component of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, which is essential for the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.</p>

<p>Although cobalt is relatively rare, it is found in ores such as smaltite (CoAs<sub>2</sub>) and cobaltite (CoAsS) in large enough concentrations to make its production economically feasible. Cobalt is a hard, bluish white metal mainly used in alloys such as stainless steel and stellite, which is an alloy of iron, copper, and tungsten used in surgical instruments. <br>The chemistry of cobalt involves mainly its 12 and 13 oxidation states, although compounds containing cobalt in the 0, 11, and 14 oxidation states are known. Aqueous solutions of cobalt(II) salts contain the Co(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub><sup>2+</sup> ion, which has a characteristic rose color. Cobalt forms a wide variety of coordination compounds, many of which will be discussed in later sections of this chapter. Some typical cobalt compounds are listed in Table 1.</p>
