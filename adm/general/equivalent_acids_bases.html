<h1>Equivalents of acids, bases and salts</h1>

<p>We've already introduced the concept of <a href="equivalent_weight.html">equivalent weight</a> or mass in chapter 1. If we want to calculate the equivalent weight of acids and bases we can apply the general definition. For acids and bases we notice that 1 gramm of hydrogen corresponds to one mole of protons, since</p>

<table>
<tr><td>H<sup>+</sup></td> <td>+</td> <td>e<sup>−</sup></td> <td>⟶</td> <td>H</td></tr>
<tr><td>1 mol<br> 1 g</td> <td></td> <td>1 mol</td> <td></td> <td>1 mol<br>1 g</td></tr>

</table>

<p>We can thus give the following definitions:</p>

<blockquote>The equivalent weight of an acid is the quantity in grams of acid that can donate 1 mole of protons to a base</blockquote>

<blockquote>The equivalent weight of a base is the quantity in grams of base that can accept 1 mole of protons from an acid</blockquote>

<p>It follows that the equivalent weight of HCl is equal to its mole since it liberates only one proton to a base. On the other hand H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, can have three equivalent weights, one equal to its mole, another to a half-mole, and another to 1/3 of its mole, depeding on the number of protons involved in the acid-base reaction. </p>

<p>For salts, since they are formed by cations and anions, one equivalent weight of a salt corresponds given the diagram above, to 1 g of hydrogen, since to neutralize a mole of a monovalent cation a mole of electron is required.</p>
