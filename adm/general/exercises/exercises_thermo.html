<h1>Exercises on thermochemistry</h1>

<ol>
	<li><p>Calculate the amount of heat that must be absorbed by 1 mol of ice at –50°C to convert it to liquid water at 70.0°C. Given: specific heat (ice) = 2.09 J/gK, (liquid) 4.18 J/ gK, and (vapour) 1.84 J/ gK. Δ<sub>fus</sub><i>H</i> = 6.01 kJ/mol and Δ<sub>vap</sub><i>H</i> = 40.67 kJ/mol for water.</p></li>

	<li><p>Two solutions, initially at 24.60 degrees celsius are mixed in a coffee cup calorimeter (Ccal = 15.5 J/ degree celsius). When a 100.0 mL volume of 0.100 M AgNO3 solution is mixed with a 100.0 mL sample of 0.200 M NaCl solution, the temperature in the calorimeter rises to 25.30 degrees celsius. Determine the &Delta;<sub>rxn</sub><i>H</i> for the reaction as written below? Assume that the density and heat capacity of the solutions is the same as that of water: 4.184 J/g°C, Density is 1.0 g/mL. NaCl(aq) + AgNO<sub>3</sub>(aq) ⟶ AgCl(s) + NaNO<sub>3</sub>(aq).</p></li>

	<li><p>The amount of heat absorbed by ice from −50 °C to 0 °C is &Delta;<i>H</i>(-50 to 0°C) = 2.09 J/gK ⋅ 50K ⋅ 8 g/mol. To this heat we must add the Δ<sub>fus</sub><i>H</i> = 6.01 kJ/mol and ultimately the heat to take liquid water from 0°C to 70°C which is &Delta;<i>H</i>(0°C to 70°C) = 4.18 J/gK ⋅ 70 K ⋅18 g/mol = 5266.8. Then &Delta;<i>H</i><sub>TOT</sub> = (5266.8+1881+6010)J = 13.5 kJ.&emsp;■</p></li>

	<li><p>Given the initial concentrations, AgNO3 is the limiting reagent, so only 0.100M x 0.1L = 0.01 mol of compounds reacted. The temperature rise is (25.30 – 24.60) = 0.7°C. The total mass of the solution is 200g, thus the amount of energy input to raise the solution temperature is: 200g ⋅ 4.184 J/g°C = 836.8 J/°C. Combining this with the heat absorbed by the calorimeter we get 836.8 + 15.5 = 852.3 J/°C. Multiplying this value by the actual temperature increase gives us the total energy from the reaction as: 852.3 J/°C ⋅ 0.7 °C = 596.61 Joules (0.5966 kJ). Now divide this number by the number of moles reacted (0.01) to get 59661 J/mol, or 59.7kJ/mol for the reaction. &emsp;■</p></li>
