<h1>Chlorine</h1>

<p>Chlorine gas, Cl<sub>2</sub>, was discovered in 1774 by the Swedish chemist Karl Wilhelm Scheele by heating hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>4HCl(aq) + MnO<sub>2</sub> (s) ⟶ MnCl<sub>2</sub> (aq) + Cl<sub>2</sub> (g) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)</p>
</div>

<p>He immediately noted the suffocating odor of the gas. Scheele also discovered that chlorine solutions could bleach cotton cloth. Within a few decades, chlorine-based bleaches became major items of commerce. Currently, chlorine is the most commercially important halogen.</p>

<p>Since the ninetheenth century, the treatement of water supplies with chlorine has helped to radically reduce diseases such as typhoid and cholera. Chlorine disinfects water by reacting with it to form chloride (I) acid, HClO (hypochlorus acid).</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Cl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O ⇌ HOCl (aq) + HCl (aq)</p>
</div>

<p>hypochlorus acid is a strong oxidising agent and a weak acid. It works as a disinfectant because the HOCl molecule can pass through the cell walls of bacteria, unlike OCl<sup>−</sup> ions. When HOCl molecules get inside a bacterial cell, they oxidise molecules involved in the cell's metabolism and structure, killing the organism.</p>

<p>Swimming pools used to be treated with chlorine gas from cylinders containing liquid chlorine under pressure. Today, swimming pools are usually treated with sodium chlorate(I), NaOCl which produces HOCl hypochlorus acid when dissolved in water:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>OCl<sup>−</sup> (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O ⇌ OH<sup>−</sup> + HOCl (aq)</p>
</div>

<h2 id="HCl">Hydrogen chloride</h2>

<p>Hydrogen chloride, HCl, is a colorless gas with a sharp, penetrating odor. The gas is very soluble in water (Figure 21.59), and the water solution is commonly referred to as hydrochloric acid. The molecular species HCl ionizes nearly completely in aqueous solution:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>HCl(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> (aq) + Cl<sup>−</sup> (aq)</p>
</div>

<p>Hydrogen chloride can be produced by heating sodium chloride with concentrated sulfuric acid.</p>

<tr><td>NaCl(s)</td> <td>+</td> <td>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (l)</td> <td>&Delta;<br>⟶</td> <td>NaHSO<sub>4</sub> (s)</td> <td>+</td> <td>HCl(g)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>On stronger heating, the sodium hydrogen sulfate reacts with sodium chloride to produce additional hydrogen chloride.</p>

<table class="noborder centertable">
<tr><td>NaCl(s)</td> <td>+</td> <td>NaHSO<sub>4</sub> (s)</td> <td>&Delta;<br>⟶</td> <td>Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (s)</td> <td>+</td> <td>HCl(g)</td></tr>
</table>
