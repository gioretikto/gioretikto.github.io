<h1>Ideal-dilute solutions, Henry's Law</h1>

<p>Some mixtures obey <a href="Raoult.html">Raoult’s law</a> very well, especially when the components are structurally similar. Mixtures that obey the law throughout the composition range from pure A to pure B are called <b>ideal solutions</b>. Raoult’s law, does not apply over the entire concentration range in a non-ideal, real solutions. However, when the solution is dilute, i.e. one component is is an large enough excess to be considered a solvent, Raoult’s law may be expressed as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>p</i><sub>solvent</sub> = x<sub>solvent</sub> <i>p<sub>solvent</sub></i>°</p>
</div>

<p>Such a relation is valid only for the solvent, however, the English chemist William Henry found experimentally that, for real solutions at low concentrations, although the vapour pressure of the solute is still proportional to its mole fraction, the constant of proportionality is not the vapour pressure of the pure substance. When B is the solute, Henry’s law is:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>p<sub>B</sub></i> = <i>x<sub>B</sub> K<sub>B</sub></i></p>
</div>

<p>In this expression <i>x<sub>B</sub></i> is the mole fraction of the solute and <i>K<sub>B</sub></i> is an empirical constant (with the dimensions of pressure) chosen so that the plot of the vapour pressure of B against its mole fraction is tangent to the experimental curve at <i>x<sub>B</sub></i> = 0. Mixtures for which the solute obeys Henry’s law and the solvent obeys Raoult’s law are called <b>ideal-dilute solutions</b>. We shall also label equations with a superscript ° when they have been derived from Henry’s law. The difference in behaviour of the solute and solvent at low concentrations (as expressed by Henry’s and Raoult’s laws, respectively) arises from the fact that in a dilute solution the solvent molecules are in an environment very much like the one they have in the pure liquid (Fig. 5.16). In contrast, the solute molecules are surrounded by solvent molecules, which is entirely different from their environment when pure. Thus, the solvent behaves like a slightly modified pure liquid, but the solute behaves entirely differently from its pure state unless the solvent and solute molecules happen to be very similar. In the latter case, the solute also obeys Raoult’s law.</p>

<p>For practical applications, Henry’s law is expressed in terms of the molality, <i>b</i>, of the solute,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>p<sub>B</sub></i> = <i>b<sub>B</sub> K<sub>B</sub></i></p>
</div>

<h3>The lowering of vapour pressure of a solvent in a mixture</h3>

<p>The value of <i>p<sub>B</sub></i>° for non-volatile solutes as it occurs for the majority of solids, is negligible compared to <i>p<sub>A</sub></i>°, and the vapor pressure of the solution amouns to <i>p<sub>A</sub></i>. Thus when a non-volatile solute is dissolved in a solvent, the partial vapor pressure of the solution is by Raoult's law</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>p</i> = <i>x<sub>A</sub> p<sub>A</sub></i>°</p>
</div>

<p>as <i>x<sub>A</sub></i> + <i>x<sub>B</sub></i> = 1, we can rewriteMiscibilità as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>p</i> = <i>p<sub>A</sub></i>° (1 − <i>x<sub>B</sub></i>) = <i>p<sub>A</sub></i>° − <i>p<sub>A</sub></i>° ⋅ <i>x<sub>B</sub></i></p>
</div>

<p>thus</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>(<i>p<sub>A</sub></i>°  − <i>p</i>)/<i>p<sub>A</sub></i>° = &Delta;<i>p</i>/<i>p<sub>A</sub></i>° = <i>x<sub>B</sub></i></p>
</div>

<p>where &Delta;<i>p</i> represents the <i>lowering of vapour pressure</i>, i.e. the difference between the vapour pressure of the pure liquid and of the solution which is proportional to the mole fraction of solute. <br> The relations obtained above depend only on <i>x<sub>A</sub></i> and <i>x<sub>B</sub></i> that is depend only on the number of solute particles present, not their identity. Such type of properties are called <b>colligative properties</b> (denoting ‘depending on the collection’).</p>

<p>The solution formed by the addition of a nonvolatile solute to a solvent has a lower freezing point, a higher boiling point, and a lower vapor pressure than that of pure solvent. These effects are related and known as colligative properties.</p>
