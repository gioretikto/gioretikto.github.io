<h1>Exceptions to the Octet Rule</h1>

<p>The exceptions in which the central atom has more than eight valence electrons around it are fairly numerous. The octet rule is certainly a pattern of second row atoms, when only four valence atomic orbitals per atom can participate in bonding (having only one 2<i>s</i> and three 2<i>p</i> orbitals available for bonding). Elements of the second period are restricted to these orbitals, but from the third period on, the elements also have unﬁlled nd orbitals, which may be used in bonding. For example, the valence-shell conﬁguration of phosphorus is 3<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>3<i>p</i><sup>3</sup>. Using just these 3<i>s</i> and 3<i>p</i> orbitals, the phosphorus atom can accept only three additional electrons, forming three covalent bonds (as in PF<sub>3</sub>). However, more bonds can be formed if the empty 3<i>d</i> orbitals of the atom are used. If each of the ﬁve electrons of the phosphorus atom is paired with unpaired electrons of ﬂuorine atoms, PF<sub>5</sub> (and PCl<sub>5</sub>) can be formed. In this way, phosphorus forms both the triﬂuoride and the pentaﬂuoride. By contrast, nitrogen (which has no available <i>d</i> orbitals in its valence shell) forms only the triﬂuoride, NF<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>The <b>octet rule</b>, therefore, only applies to second row elements but even here, fewer than eight electrons are possible: Boron and Beylium tend to form compounds in which they have fewer than eight electrons around them.</p>

<p>Boron trifluoride, as BH<sub>3</sub> has only 6 electrons in the valence shell. BF<sub>3</sub>, a gas at normal temperatures and pressures, reacts very energetically with molecules such as water and ammonia that have available electron pairs (lone pairs). The violent reactivity of BF<sub>3</sub> with electron-rich molecules arises because the boron atom is electron-deficient.</p>

<p>We actually <i>can</i> satisfy the octet rule for B in BF<sub>3</sub> by using a lone pair on one of the F atoms to form a double bond between the F atom and B. This gives rise to three additional resonance structures:</p>

<p>Although these resonance structures result in B carrying a negative formal charge while F carries a positive formal chare, a situation that is inconsistent with the electronegativities of the atoms involved, the experimentally determined bond lenght in BF<sub>3</sub> (130.9 pm) is shorter than a single bond (137.3 pm), which indicates partial double-bond character. The shorter bond length would appear to support the idea behind the three resonance structures.<br>However, there is evidence to suggest that the ﬁrst formula written—the one with all single bonds and in which boron has only six electrons around it—describes the chemistry of boron triﬂuoride very well. For example, boron triﬂuoride reacts with molecules having a lone pair, such as with ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>, to give the compound BF<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>. The reaction is easy to describe in terms of the formula in which boron has only six electrons around it.</p>

<img src="img/BF3_NH3.png" alt="BF3_NH3"/>

<p>In this reaction, a coordinate covalent bond forms between the boron and nitrogen atoms, and the boron achieves an octet of electrons. The chemistry of BF<sub>3</sub> thus appears to support an electron structure with boron having only six electrons around it. No doubt, resonance involving all four of the Lewis formulas that we have drawn best describes the actual electron structure of boron triﬂuoride, but the relative importance of the different resonance formulas is not settled.</p>

<p>The B−N bond in BF<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub> is different from the covalent bonds discussed so far in the sense that both electrons are contributed by  the N atom. This type of bond is called <b>coordinate covalent bond</b> (also referred to as a <b>dative bond</b>), which is defined as a covalent bond in which one of the atoms donates both electron. Although the properties of a coordinate covalent bond do not differ from those of a normal covalent bond (i.e., the electrons are shared in both cases), the distinctions is useful for keeping track of valence electrons and assigning fromal charges.</p>
