<h1>Sulfur</h1>

<p>Sulfur is found in nature both in large deposits of the free element in several contires, including the USA, Mexico, Japan and Italy (Sicily). Sulphur is found in sulfate ores such as <i>galena</i> (PbS), <i>cinnabar</i> (HgS), <i>pyrite</i> (FeS<sub>2</sub>), <i>gypsum</i> (CaSO<sub>4</sub> ⋅ 2H<sub>2</sub>O), <i>epsomite</i> (MgSO<sub>4</sub> ⋅ 7H<sub>2</sub> O), and glauberite (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> ⋅ CaSO<sub>4</sub>). In contrast to oxygen, elemental sulfur exists as S<sub>2</sub> molecules only in the gas phase at high temperatures. Sulfur forms several polyatomic molecules. The best-known allotrope is octasulfur, cyclo-S<sub>8</sub>. Because sulfur atoms form much stronger <i>&sigma;</i> bonds than <i>&pi;</i> bonds, S<sub>2</sub> is less stable at 25 °C than larger aggregates such as S<sub>6</sub> and S<sub>8</sub> rings and S<sub><i>n</i></sub> chains. The most stable form of sulfur at 25 °C and 1 atm is called <b>rhombic sulfur</b>, which contains stacked S<sub>8</sub> rings. If rhombic sulfur is melted and heated to 120 °C, it forms <i>monoclinic sulfur</i> as it slowly cools [Fig. 2]. The monoclinic form also contains S<sub>8</sub> rings, but the rings are stacked differently than in rhombic sulfur.</p>

<p>If, instead of cooling the liquid sulfur, you raise its temperature above 160°C, the sulfur begins to darken and at somewhat higher temperatures changes to a dark reddish brown, viscous liquid.</p>

<p>The original melt consists of S<sub>8</sub> molecules, but these rings of sulfur atoms open up, and the fragments join to give long spiral chains of sulfur atoms. The spiral chains have unpaired electrons at their ends, and these unpaired electrons are responsible for the color. The viscosity of the liquid increases as compact S<sub>8</sub> molecules are replaced by long spiral chains that can intertwine. At temperatures greater than 200°C, the chains begin to break apart and the viscosity decreases. <br> Figure 21.54 shows the appearance of sulfur at various temperatures. <br> When molten sulfur above 160°C (but below 200°C) is poured into water, the liquid changes to a rubbery mass, called plastic sulfur. Plastic sulfur is an amorphous mixture of sulfur chains. The rubberiness of this sulfur results from the ability of the spiral chains of sulfur atoms to stretch and then relax to their original length. Plastic sulfur reverts to rhombic sulfur after a period of time. <br> Sulfur boils at 445°C, giving a vapor of S<sub>8</sub>, S<sub>6</sub>, S<sub>4</sub>, and S<sub>2</sub> molecules. Measurements of vapor density depend on the temperature, as a result of these different species of molecular sulfur in the vapor. </p>

<p>In living organism, sulfur is an essential constituent of proteins and certain amino acids, namely cysteine and methionine. Sulfur is often regarded as an "organic" element in biology and can form self-linkage to ptoduce long −S−S−S−S− chains. The S−S bonds are particularly important in proteins, froming intermolecular and intramolecular bonds. </p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ul>
	<li><p>Elemental sulfur is one of the oldest <b>fungicides</b> and <b>pesticides</b>. "Dusting sulfur", elemental sulfur in powdered form, is a common fungicide for grapes, strawberry, many vegetables and several other crops;</p></li>

	<li><p><b>Fertilizer</b>: Amino acids synthesized by living organisms such as methionine and cysteine contain organosulfur groups (thioester and thiol respectively). The plants requirement for sulfur equals or exceeds the requirement for phosphorus;</p></li>

	<li><p>It remains an ingredient of black <a href="gunpowder.html">Gunpowder</a>.</p></li>

	<li><p id="soda">Sulfur deposits in Sicily were the dominant source for more than a century. By the late 18th century, about 2,000 tonnes per year of sulfur were imported into Marseille, France, for the production of <b>sulfuric acid</b> for use in the <b>Leblanc process</b>, processo chimico industriale per la sintesi del carbonato di sodio, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (o "soda") ampiamente utilizzato in passato, e ora obsoleto.  </p>

	<img src="img/Leblanc.png" alt="Leblanc's process"/>

	<p>Il processo Leblanc avveniva in due stadi:

    nel primo stadio il cloruro di sodio veniva convertito in solfato di sodio:

<div class="eq">
<p>2 NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2 HCl↑</p>
</div>
    
<p>nel secondo stadio una miscela di solfato di sodio, carbone e carbonato di calcio veniva sottoposta a riscaldamento, ottenendo carbonato di sodio e solfuro di calcio:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2C → Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + CaS + 2 CO<sub>2</sub>↑</p> 
</div>

<p>Il carbonato di sodio veniva infine separato dagli altri prodotti del processo per lisciviazione. </p>
    
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sulfur Oxides</h2>

<p>From its position below oxygen in the periodic table, we might expect the simplest stable oxide of sulfur to have the formula SO. However, <i>sulfur monoxide</i>, which can be produced in small amounts when gaseous sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) is subjected to an electrical discharge, is very unstable. The difference in the stabilities of the O<sub>2</sub> and SO molecules probably reflects the much stronger <i>&pi;</i> bonding between oxygen atoms than between a sulfur and an oxygen atom.<br> Sulfur burns in air with a bright blue flame to give <i>sulfur dioxide</i> (SO<sub>2</sub>), a colorless gas with a pungent odor, which condenses to a liquid at −10°C and 1 atm. Sulfur dioxide is a V-shaped molecule, which is a very effective antibacterial agent often used to preserve stored fruit.</p>

<p>Sulfur dioxide reacts with oxygen to produce <i>sulfur trioxide</i> (SO<sub>3</sub>):</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>2SO<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) ⟶ 2SO<sub>3</sub>(g)</p>
</div>

<p>However, this reaction is very slow in the absence of a catalyst. One of the mysteries during early research on air pollution was how the sulfur dioxide produced from the combustion of sulfur-containing fuels is so rapidly converted to sulfur trioxide in the atmosphere. It is now known that dust and other particles can act as heterogeneous catalysts for this process.</p>

<h2>Oxyacids of Sulfur</h2>

<p>Sulfur dioxide dissolves in water to form an acidic solution. The reaction is often represented as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>SO<sub>2</sub> (g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) ⟶ H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>(aq)</p>
</div>

<p>where H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> is called sulfurous acid. However, very little H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> actually exists in the solution. The major form of sulfur dioxide in water is SO<sub>2</sub>, and the acid dissociation equilibria are best represented as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>SO<sub>2</sub> (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) ⇌ H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> (aq) &emsp; K<sub>a<sub>1</sub></sub> = 1.5 x 10<sup>&minus;2</sup></p>
<p>HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> ⇌ H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> (aq) &emsp; K<sub>a<sub>2</sub></sub> = 1.0 x 10<sup>&minus;7</sup></p>
</div>

<p>This situation is analogous to the behavior of carbon dioxide in water (see Section 13‐7). Although H 2 SO 3 cannot be isolated, salts of SO 322 (sulfites) and HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> (hydrogen sulfites) are well known.<br> Sulfur trioxide reacts violently with water to produce the diprotic acid sulfuric acid:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>SO<sub>3</sub> (g) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) ⟶ H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq)</p>
</div>

<p id="contact">Manufactured in greater amounts than any other chemical, sulfuric acid is usually produced by the <b>contact process</b>, an industrial method for the manufacture of sulfuric acid. It consists of the reaction of sulfur dioxide with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide using a catalyst of vanadium(V) oxide, followed by the reaction of sulfur trioxide with water. Because the direct reaction of sulfur trioxide with water produces mists that are unmanageable, the sulfur trioxide is actually dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid, which is then diluted with water.

<p>About 60% of the sulfuric acid manufactured in the United States is used to produce fertilizers from phosphate rock. The other 40% is used in lead storage batteries, in petroleum refining, in steel manufacturing, and for various other purposes in the chemical industry. <br>Because sulfuric acid has a high affinity for water, it is often used as a dehydrating agent. Gases that do not react with sulfuric acid, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, are often dried by bubbling them through concentrated solutions of the acid. Sulfuric acid is such a powerful dehydrating agent that it will remove hydrogen and oxygen from a substance in a 2:1 ratio even when the substance contains no molecular water. For example, concentrated sulfuric acid reacts vigorously with common table sugar (sucrose), leaving a charred mass of carbon (Fig. 19‐24):</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub> (s) + 11 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (conc)  ⟶ 12C (s) + 111H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> ⋅ H<sub>2</sub>O (l)</p>
</div>

p>Hydrogen sulfide, H<sub>2</sub>S, has a bent molecular geometry, like water. Unlike water, however, H<sub>2</sub>S is a gas under standard conditions (mp, −85.6 °C; bp, −60.3 °C) because its intermolecular forces are weak compared with the strong hydrogen bonding in water. Hydrogen sulfide is poisonous, comparable in toxicity to hydrogen cyanide, but fortunately it has a terrible odor and is detectable in concentrations as low as 0.02 ppm. You must be careful with H<sub>2</sub>S, though. Because it has an anesthetic effect, your nose rapidly loses its ability to detect it. Death occurs at H<sub>2</sub>S concentrations of 100 ppm. Sulfur is often found as the sulfide ion in conjunction with metals because all metal sulfides (except those based on Group 1A metals) are insoluble. The recovery of metals from their sulfide ores usually begins by heating the ore in air.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>2PbS(s) ​+  ​3O<sub>2</sub> (g) → 2PbO(s) ​+  ​2SO<sub>2</sub> (g)</p>
</div>

<p>Here, lead(II) sulfide is converted to lead(II) oxide, and this is then reduced to lead using carbon or carbon monoxide in a blast furnace.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>PbO(s) ​+  ​CO(g) → Pb(l) ​+  ​CO<sub>2</sub> (g)</p>
</div>

<div class="def">
<p><b>Halitosis</b> or “bad breath” is due to three sulfurcontaining compounds: H<sub>2</sub>S, CH<sub>3</sub>SH (methyl mercaptan), and (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S (dimethyl sulfide). All three can be detected in very tiny concentrations. For example, your nose knows if as little as 0.2 microgram of CH<sub>3</sub>SH is present per liter of air. The compounds result from bacteria’s attack on the sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine in food particles in the mouth.</p>
</div>

<p>Alternatively, the oxide can be reduced to elemental lead by combining it with fresh lead sulfide.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>2PbO(s) + PbS(s) → 3 Pb(s) + SO<sub>2</sub> (g)</p>
</div>

<p>Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), a colorless, toxic gas with a sharp odor, is produced on an enormous scale by the combustion of sulfur and by roasting sulfide ores in air.</p>

<img src="img/SO2.png" alt="Sulfur dioxide"/>

<p>The combustion of sulfur in sulfur-containing coal and fuel oil creates particularly large environmental problems. It has been estimated that about 2.0 × 10<sup>8</sup> tons of sulfur oxides (primarily SO<sub>2</sub>) are released into the atmosphere each year by human activities; this is more than half of the total emitted by all other natural sources of sulfur in the environment. Sulfur dioxide readily dissolves in water. The most important reaction of this gas is its oxidation to SO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>SO<sub>2</sub> (g) + 1⁄2 O<sub>2</sub> (g) → SO<sub>3</sub> (g) &emsp; ∆<sub>r</sub><i>H</i>° = −98.9 kJ/mol</p>
</div>

<p>Sulfur trioxide is <b>almost never isolated</b> but is converted directly to sulfuric acid by reaction with water in the “contact process.” The largest use of sulfur is the production of sulfuric acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, the compound produced in largest quantity by the chemical industry ( ◀ page 133). In the United States, roughly 70% of the acid is used to manufacture superphosphate fertilizer from phosphate rock. Plants need a soluble form of phosphorus for growth, but calcium phosphate and apatite [Ca<sub>5</sub>X(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> , X = F, OH, Cl] are insoluble. Treating phosphate-containing minerals with sulfuric acid produces a mixture of soluble phosphates. The balanced equation for the reaction of excess sulfuric acid and calcium phosphate, for example, is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Ca<sub>3</sub> (PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (s) + 3 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (l) → 2 H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (l) + 3 CaSO<sub>4</sub> (s)</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Frasch">Production of Sulfur</h2>

<p>About 60% of the sulfur produced in the United States comes from the underground deposits of elemental sulfur found in Texas and Louisiana. This sulfur is recovered by using the <b>Frasch process</b> developed by Herman Frasch in the 1890s. Superheated water is pumped into the deposit to melt the sulfur (mp = 113°C), which is then forced to the surface by air pressure. <br> A sulfur well is similar to an oil well but consists of three concentric pipes. Superheated water flows down the outer pipe, and compressed air flows down the inner pipe. The superheated water melts the sulfur, which is then pushed up the middle pipe by the compressed air. Molten sulfur spews from the well and solidifies in large storage areas. Sulfur obtained this way is 99.6% pure.</p>

</figure>

<p id="Claus">Hydrogen sulfide, H<sub>2</sub>S, recovered from natural gas and petroleum is also a source of free sulfur. The sulfur is obtained from the hydrogen sulfide gas by the <b>Claus process,</b>
a method of obtaining free sulfur by the partial burning of hydrogen sulfide. The partial burning of hydrogen sulfide produces some sulfur, as well as sulfur dioxide.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>8H<sub>2</sub> S(g) + 4O<sub>2</sub> (g) ⟶ S 8 (s) + 8H<sub>2</sub>O(g)<br>2H<sub>2</sub>S(g) + 3O<sub>2</sub> (g) + 2SO<sub>2</sub> (g) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(g)</p>
</div>

<p>The sulfur dioxide that forms reacts with the hydrogen sulfide to produce more sulfur.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>16H<sub>2</sub>S(g) + 8SO<sub>2</sub> (g) ⟶ 3S<sub>8</sub> (s) + 16H<sub>2</sub>O(g)</p>
</div>

<p>Most of the sulfur produced (almost 90%) is used to make sulfuric acid. The remainder has a wide variety of uses, including the vulcanization of rubber (sulfur converts the initially tacky material into useful rubber), the production of carbon disulfide (to make cellophane), and the preparation of sulfur dioxide for bleaching.</p>
