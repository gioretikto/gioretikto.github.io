<h1>Antidoping</h1>
      
<p>The U.S. Anti-doping agency is responsible for testing for performance-enhancing drugs such as synthetic testosterone that has benn used by athletes. Testosterone (T) and epitestosterone (E) are closely related steroids, and both are produced naturally. (The latter is an <i>isomer</i> of testosterone). In most adult men the compounds are found in about equal amounts, although the natural T/E ratio can be as high as 4/1. To allow for elevated natural testosterone levels, the Anti-Dopin Agency considers that a ratio of 6/1 is an indication an athlete must be using synthetic testosterone. This situation arose when the winner of the 2006 Tour de France bicycle race, Floyd Landis, was found to have a ration of T/E = 11/1 based on a urine test after one stage of the race. When the race  was over, and the drug-testing results were announced, Landis strongly denied taking testosterone. He argued that his body may have produced more testosterone than normal because of the rigors of the race. This prompted the doping-control laboratory for the Tour to seek additional evidence. They used a technique developed by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency called "<b>isotope ratio mass spectrometry</b>", which measures the ration of carbon isotopes, <sup>12</sup>C and <sup>13</sup>C, in compounds.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>C, is a naturally occuring isotope of carbon. When most plants grow using CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere, about 1% of the C atoms incorporated in the plant are <sup>13</sup>C.</p> The <sup>13</sup>C is ingested either directly by humans when eating plants or directly. The <sup>13</sup>C is ingested either direclty by humans when eating plants or indirecly when eating meat from grazing animals, and it is then incorporated into the carbon-containing molecules, including testosteronem, that out bodie build. Synthetic testosterone is made from wild yams and soy, plants that are so-called warm climate <a href="../biochemestry/C3C4plants.html">"C3 plants"</a> that take up atmosperic CO<sub>2</sub>, differently than temperature-zone "C4 plants". One imporant result of this difference is that C3 plants have a lower <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio than C4 plants. Because diets in most industrialized countries derive form a mixture of C3 and C4 plants, the natural testosterone in male athletes in most countries will have a different <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio than testosterone. A skilled scientist with a mass spectrometer, can relatevely easily detect the difference. In the Tour the france case, the <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio added further evidence to the case that illegal steroid use had occured.</p>
