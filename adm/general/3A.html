<h1>The Group 3A Elements</h1>

<p>The Group 3A elements (valence electron configuration <i>ns</i><sup>2</sup>np<sup>1</sup>) generally show the increase in metallic character in going down the group that is characteristic of the representative elements. Some physical properties, sources, and methods
of preparation of the Group 3A elements are summarized in Table 1.</p>

<p><i>Boron</i> is a typical nonmetal, and most of its compounds are covalent. The most interesting compounds of boron are the covalent hydrides called boranes. We might expect BH<sub>3</sub> to be the simplest hydride, since boron has three valence electrons to share with three hydrogen atoms. However, this compound is unstable, and the simplest known member of the series is diborane (B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), with the structure shown in Fig. 1(a). In this molecule the terminal B−H bonds are normal covalent bonds, each involving one electron pair. The bridging bonds are three-center bonds similar to those in solid BeH<sub>2</sub>. Another interesting borane contains the square pyramidal B<sub>5</sub>H<sub>9</sub> molecule [Fig. 1(b)], which has four three-center bonds situated around the base of the pyramid. Because the boranes are extremely electron-deficient, they are highly reactive. The boranes react very exothermically with oxygen and were once evaluated as potential fuels for rockets in the U.S. space program.</p>

<p><i>Aluminum</i>, the most abundant metal on earth, has metallic physical properties, such as high thermal and electrical conductivities and a lustrous appearance; however, its bonds to nonmetals are significantly covalent. This covalency is responsible for the amphoteric nature of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which dissolves in acidic or basic solution, and for the acidity of Al(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub><sup>3+</sup> (see <a href="acid_base_salts.html#acid">Acid-base properits of salts</a>):</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Al(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub><sup>3+</sup> (aq) ⇌ Al(OH)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub><sup>2+</sup> (aq) + H<sup>+</sup> (aq)</p>
</div>

<p>One especially interesting property of <i>gallium</i> is its unusually low melting point of 29.8°C, which is in contrast to the 660°< melting point of aluminum. Also, since gallium’s boiling point is about 2400°C, it has the largest liquid range of any metal. This makes it useful for thermometers, especially to measure high temperatures. Gallium, like water, expands when it freezes. The chemistry of gallium is quite similar to that of aluminum. For example, Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is amphoteric. <br> The chemistry of indium is similar to that of aluminum and gallium except that compounds containing the 1+ ion are known, such as InCl and In<sub>2</sub>O, in 
addition to those with the more common 3+ ion. The chemistry of thallium is completely metallic. <br> Table 2 summarizes some important reactions of the Group 3A elements.</p>
