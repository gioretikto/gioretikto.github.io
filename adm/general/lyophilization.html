<h1>Freeze-drying, or lyophilization</h1>

<p><b>Freeze-drying</b>, or <b>lyophilization</b>, is a dehydration process used to sublimate water in a frozen product: water in the product passes directly from the solid to gas phase, bypassing the liquid phase. Sublimation can only occur if the temperature and partial pressure of water vapor are below the triple point. The process is endothermic: heat must be applied to the frozen food to sustain sublimation. Latent heat of sublimation is almost 2.800 kJ for removing 1 kg of water; It is therefore necessary to supply heat in a carefully controlled manner so as to avoid even partial meltin of the frozen water. Froze-drying removes water from foods and the resulting food product can be stored almost indefinetely, since bacteria cannot grow in them without water.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>The first step is to freeze the product to a temperature of −40°C;</p></li>
	<li><p>Then lower the pressure to a vacuum of about 0.01 mbar.</p></li>
	<li><p>Under vacuum conditions, heating can be initiated which leads to sublimation. At this point the water (in the form of ice) in the product changes to gas (vapour) and separates from the product;</p></li>
	<li><p>The vapour is collected in the condenser of the freeze-drying equipment. Atmospheric pressure is recovered to extract the freeze-dried material and vacuum pack it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Apart from avoiding ice crystals melting, the structural rigidity of the frozen food matrix must also be maintained to obtain an optimally freeze-dried product. It is important that the primary drying phase is performed at a temperatura that is 2-5 °C below the so-called product collapse temperature (<i>T<sub>c</sub></i>) to avoid structural collapse. <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> is defined as the point at which an amorphous material in the frozen state when subjected to vacuum can no longer maintain its structure and hence undergoes collapse as the solvent is removed during dtying. The collapse temperature is closely related to the glass transition temperature <i>T<sub>g</sub></i>, which can be defined as the temperature at which there is a change in physical state from glassy to rubbery viscous liquid wihtout phase change.</p>

<p>The main elements of a freeze dryer include</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>A vacuum-tight chamber.</p></li>
	<li><p>a vacuum pump to remove air and other noncondensable gases.</p></li>
	<li><p>A condenser to remove water: it is removed in order to maintain the partial pressure of water vapor at a low level. This can be done by condensation at low temperature (usually as ice) or by using a very dry gas at atmospheric pressure.</p></li>
	<li><p>some means to supply heat.</p></li>
