<h1>Periodic Trends in Atomic Properties</h1>

<p>We have developed a fairly complete picture of polyelectronic atoms that is quite successful in accounting for the periodic table of elements. We will next use the model to account for the observed trends in several important atomic properties: ionization energy, electron affinity, and atomic size.</p>

<h2>Ionization Energy</h2>

<p><b>Ionization energy</b> is the energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom or ion,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>X(g) ⟶ X<sup>+</sup>(g) + e<sup>−</sup></p>
</div>

<p>where the atom or ion is assumed to be in its ground state. Although the values for ionization energy will be given in this text in terms of kilojoules per mole of atoms, it is quite common in other chemical literature to see values given per atom. In that context the term ionization potential is used, and the units are  electron-volts (eV) per atom (1 eV = 1.602 x 10<sup>−19</sup> J). The ionization energy for a particular electron in an atom is a source of information about the energy of the orbital it occupies in the atom. In fact,
Koopmans’ theorem states: The ionization energy of an electron is equal to the energy of the orbital from which it came. This rule is an approximation because, among other things, it assumes that the electrons left behind in the resulting ion will not reorganize in response to the removal of an electron. However, ionization energies do provide information that is quite useful in testing the orbital model of the atom.</p>

<p>To introduce some of the characteristics of ionization energy, we will consider the energy required to remove several electrons in succession from aluminum atoms in the gaseous state. The ionization energies are</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Al(g) ⟶ Al<sup>+</sup> (g) + e<sup>−</sup> &emsp; I<sub>1</sub> = 580 kJ/mol <br>
Al<sup>+</sup> (g) ⟶ Al<sup>2+</sup> (g) + e<sup>−</sup> &emsp; I<sub>2</sub> = 1815 kJ/mol <br>
Al<sup>2+</sup> (g) ⟶ Al<sup>3+</sup> (g) + e<sup>−</sup> &emsp; I<sub>3</sub> = 2740 kJ/mol <br>
Al<sup>3+</sup> (g) ⟶ Al<sup>4+</sup> (g) + e<sup>−</sup> &emsp; I<sub>4</sub> = 11,600 kJ/mol</p>
</div>

<p>Several important points can be illustrated from these results. In a stepwise ionization process, it is always the highest-energy electron (the one bound least tightly) that is removed first. The energy required to remove the highest-energy electron of an atom is called the <b>first ionization energy</b> (I<sub>1</sub>). The first electron removed from the aluminum atom comes from the 3<i>p</i> orbital (Al has the electron configuration [Ne]3<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>3p<sup>1</sup>). The second electron comes from the 3<i>s</i> orbital (since Al<sup>+</sup> has the configuration [Ne]3<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>). <br> Note that the value of <i>I</i><sub>1</sub> is considerably smaller than the value of <i>I</i><sub>2</sub>, the second ionization energy. This result makes sense for several reasons. The primary factor is simply charge. Note that the first electron is removed from a neutral atom (Al), whereas the second electron is removed from a 11 ion (Al<sup>+</sup>). The increase in positive charge binds the electrons more firmly and the ionization energy increases. The same trend shows up in the third (<i>I</i><sub>3</sub>) and fourth (<i>I</i><sub>4</sub>) ionization energies, where the electron is removed from the Al<sup>2+</sup> and Al<sup>3+</sup> ions, respectively. <br> The increase in successive ionization energies for an atom also makes sense in terms of relative orbital energies. The increase from I<sub>1</sub> to I<sub>2</sub> is expected because the first electron is removed from a 3<i>p</i> orbital that is higher in energy than the 3<i>s</i> orbital from which the second electron is removed. The largest jump in ionization energy by far occurs in going from the third ionization energy (I<sub>3</sub>) to the fourth (<i>I</i><sub>4</sub>). This large jump occurs because <i>I</i><sub>4</sub> corresponds to removing a core electron (Al<sup>3+</sup> has the configuration 1<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>p</i><sup>6</sup>), and core electrons are bound much more tightly than valence electrons.<br> Table 12.6 gives the values of ionization energies for all the Period 3 elements. Note the large jump in energy in each case in going from the removal of valence electrons to the removal of core electrons.<br> The values of the first ionization energy for the elements in the first five periods of the periodic table are graphed in Fig. 12.35. Note that, in general, as we go <i>across a period from left to right, the first ionization energy increases</i>. To account for this trend qualitatively, we need to consider more fully the concept of electrons shielding each other from the nuclear charge. Shielding occurs because electrons repel each other. Our simple pictures of the atom lead us to expect that core electrons should be quite effective in shielding outer electrons from the nuclear charge, since the core electrons are between the nucleus and the outer electrons. On the other hand, electrons in the same principal quantum level, which on the average are all at about the same distance from the nucleus, are not expected to shield each other very well. Thus, as we move from left to right in a given period of the periodic table, we do not expect the electrons to completely shield each other from the increasing nuclear charge as the number of protons in the nucleus increases. The electrons are expected to be bound more firmly in going from left to right across a given period, which means that the ionization energy should increase. <br>  On the other hand, <i>the first ionization energy values decrease in going down a group</i>. This can be seen most clearly by focusing on the Group 1A elements (the alkali metals) and the Group 8A elements (the noble gases), as shown in Table 12.7. The main reason for the decrease in going down a group is that the electrons being removed are, on average, farther from the nucleus. As n increases, the size of the orbital increases, and the electron is easier to remove.<br> In Fig. 12.35 we see that there are some discontinuities in ionization energy in going across a period. For example, discontinuities occur in Period 2, in going from beryllium to boron and from nitrogen to oxygen. These exceptions to the normal trend can be explained in terms of how electron repulsions depend on the electron configuration. We will discuss the elements in Period 2 individually to further develop the concept of shielding. The increase in the ionization energy in going from lithium (1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>1</sup>) to beryllium (1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>) is expected, since the 2<i>s</i> electrons do not shield each other completely. The decrease in the ionization energy in going from beryllium (1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>) to boron (1<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2p<sup>1</sup>) suggests that the electrons in the 2<i>s</i> orbital effectively shield the 2<i>p</i> electron. This is sensible in view of the greater penetration by the 2s electrons as compared with the 2<i>p</i> electron. The 2s electrons spend more time closer to the nucleus than the 2p electrons, where they provide effective shielding. The steady increase in the ionization energy in going from boron (1<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>p</i><sup>1</sup>) to carbon (1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>2</sup>) to nitrogen (1s<sup>2</sup>2<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>p</i><sup>3</sup>) is expected because the 2p electrons are not very effective in shielding each other from the increasing nuclear charge. The drop in the ionization energy in going from nitrogen (1<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>p</i><sup>3</sup>) to oxygen (1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2<i>p</i><sup>4</sup>) is usually explained as follows: In nitrogen each 2<i>p</i> electron is in a separate orbital. When the extra electron for oxygen is added, one 2<i>p</i> orbital becomes doubly occupied. The electron repulsions between the electrons in the doubly occupied orbital make either of these electrons easier to remove.* As we move from oxygen (1<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>4</sup>) to fluorine (1<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>p</i><sup>5</sup>) to neon (1<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>s</i><sup>2</sup> 2<i>p</i><sup>6</sup>), the ionization energy increases because in each case the electron being considered is in a doubly occupied orbital. Note that the ionization energy values for oxygen, fluorine, and neon are different from those of boron, carbon, and nitrogen by an amount that represents the extra electron repulsions in doubly occupied orbitals, as shown in Fig. 12.35.</p>

<h2 id="EA">Electron Affinity</h2>

<p>Our look at ionization energies concerned the energy required to generate <i>positive ions (cations)</i> from neutral atoms. The other side of the “ionization coin” is the generation of <i>negative ions (anions)</i>. <br> <b>Electron affinity</b> is the energy change associated with the addition of an electron to a gaseous atom:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>X(g) + e<sup>−</sup> ⟶ X<sup>−</sup> (g)</p>
</div>

<p>For example</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>F(g) + e<sup>−</sup> ⟶ F<sup>−</sup> (g) &emsp; −328 kj/mol <br>
Cl (g) + e<sup>−</sup> ⟶ Cl<sup>−</sup> (g) &emsp; −349 kj/mol <br>
Br (g) + e<sup>−</sup> ⟶ Br<sup>−</sup> (g) &emsp; −349 kj/mol <br>
I (g) + e<sup>−</sup> ⟶ I<sup>−</sup> (g) &emsp; −295 kj/mol <br>
At (g) + e<sup>−</sup> ⟶ At<sup>−</sup> (g) &emsp; −295 kj/mol </p>
</div>

<p>The values indicate to us that electron affinities generally become <i>less negative</i> (or more positive), corresponding to less energy being released, as we move down a group. Because added electrons are farther from the nuclei of larges atoms, they interact less wih the positive charge of the nucleus. There are many exceptions, however, such as more energy released when a chloride ion forms, in the above list, thatn upo formation of the fluoride anion. In searching for a possible explanation, we should note that fluorine is the smallest of this group of atoms, so the electrons in the outer <i>p</i> orbitals, to which the extra electron is being added, will be much closer together than in the other atoms of this group. The larger electron-electron repulsion between these closely spaced electrons, compared to those of other halogen atoms, will be associated with increased potential energy. <br> Note as well that the values indicate that electron affinity values generally get more negative as we move from the left to the right along a period in the periodic table. We know from our understanding of the trend associated with atomic radii that atoms get smaller as we move to the right along the periodic table. </p>

<p>For example, the fact that the nitrogen atom does not form a stable, isolated N<sup>−</sup> (g) ion, whereas carbon forms C<sup>−</sup> (g), reflects the difference in the electron configurations of these atoms. An electron added to nitrogen (1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>3</sup>) to form the N<sup>−</sup> (g) ion (1<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>p</i><sup>4</sup>) would have to occupy a 2<i>p</i> orbital that already contains one electron. The extra repulsion between the electrons in this doubly occupied orbital causes N<sup>−</sup> (g) to be unstable. When an electron is added to carbon (1<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>2<i>p</i><sup>2</sup>) to form the C<sup>2−</sup> (g) ion (1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>3</sup>), no such extra repulsions occur. <br> In contrast to the nitrogen atom, the oxygen atom can add one electron to form the stable O<sub>2</sub> (g) ion. Presumably, oxygen’s greater nuclear charge, compared with that of nitrogen, is sufficient to overcome the repulsion associated with putting a second electron into an already occupied 2<i>p</i> orbital. However, it should be noted that a second electron cannot be added to an oxygen atom [O<sup>−</sup> (g) + e<sup>−</sup> ↛ O<sup>2−</sup> (g)] to form an isolated oxide ion. This outcome seems strange in view of the many stable oxide compounds (MgO, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and so on) that are known. As we will discuss in detail in Chapter 13, the O<sup>2−</sup> ion is stabilized in ionic compounds by the large attractions that occur among the positive ions and the oxide ions.</p>

<p>He, Be, N, Ne, Mg, and Ar atoms do not add an electron exothermically and thus <b>do not form stable</b>, isolated X<sup>2−</sup> ions.</p>
