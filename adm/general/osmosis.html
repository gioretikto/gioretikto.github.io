<h1>Osmosis</h1>

<p>Another colligative properties similar to the lowering of vapor pressure, when a non-volatile solute is added to the solvent is the lowering of <b>osmotic pressure</b>. <br> A solution and pure solvent are separated by a semipermeable membrane, which allows solvent but not solute molecules to pass through. As time passes, the volume of the solution increases, whereas that of the solvent decreases. This flow of solvent into the solution through the semipermeable membrane is called <b>osmosis</b>. Eventually the liquid levels stop changing, indicating that the system has reached equilibrium. Because the liquid levels are different at this point, there is a greater hydrostatic pressure on the solution than on the pure solvent. This excess pressure is called the osmotic pressure. We can take another view of this phenomenon, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Osmosis can be prevented by applying a pressure to the solution. The pressure that just stops the osmosis is equal to the osmotic pressure of the solution.</p>

<p>Osmotic pressure is a solution phenomenon quite akin to vapor pressure. We have seen that a decrease vapor pressure occurs at an air-solution boundary because the solute is not volatile. An analogous situation can occur in solution if there is a semipermeal membrane (not unlike that used to encase sausage or hot dogs) containing a solute (e.g. proteins) in pure water. Because the water inside the tube is at a lower concentration thatn the pure water outside, its pressure is decreased somewhat, just as the vapor pressure would be. As a result water enter the membrane until reaching an equilibrium at which the water pressure is the same across the membrane (analogous to equilibrium vapor pressure). The osmotic pressure &pi; is defined as the pressure difference across the membrane at equilibrium and can be shown to satisfy</p>

<p>where <i>n</i> is the number of molec of solute, assumed to be dilute and <i>V</i> is the volume of the solution withn the membrane, <i>R</i> is the gas law constant, and <i>T</i> is the Kelvin temperature.</p>

<p>Solutions that have identical osmotic pressures are said to be <b>isotonic solutions</b>. Fluids administered intravenously must be isotonic with body fluids. Cells immersed in a solution with lower ion content (hypotonic) will swell, leading eventually to a rupture (<i>lysis</i>) of the cell membrane. If cells are bathed in a hypertonic solution, the cells will shrivel (<i>crenation</i>) because of a net transfer of water out of the cells. <br> We can use the phenomenon of crenation to our advantage. Food can be preserved by treating its surface with a solute that forms a solution hypertonic to bacteria cells. Bacteria on the food then tend to shrivel and die. This is why salt can be used to protect meat and sugar can be used to protect fruit.</p>

<p id="dialysis">In osmosis a semipermeable membrane prevents transfer of <i>all</i> solute particles. A similar phenomenon called <b>dialysis</b> occurs at the walls of most plant and animal cells. However, in this case the membrane allows transfer of both solvent molecules and <i>small</i> solute molecules and ions. One of the most important applications of dialysis is the use of artificial kidney machines to purify the blood. The blood is passed through a cellophane tube, which acts as the semipermeable membrane. The tube is immersed in a dialyzing solution. This “washing” solution contains the same concentrations of ions and small molecules as blood but has none of the waste products normally removed by the kidneys. The resulting dialysis of waste products cleanses the blood.</p>

<h2 id="reverse">Reverse Osmosis</h2>

<p>If a solution in contact with pure solvent across a semipermeable membrane is subjected to an external pressure larger than its osmotic pressure, <b>reverse osmosis</b> occurs. The pressure will cause a net flow of solvent from the solution to the solvent, as shown in Fig. 17.18. In reverse osmosis, the semipermeable membrane acts as a “molecular filter” to remove solute particles. This fact is potentially applicable to the desalination (removal of dissolved salts) of seawater, which is highly hypertonic to body fluids and thus is not drinkable. A small-scale, manually operated reverse osmosis desalinator has been developed by the U.S. Navy to provide fresh water on life rafts (Fig. 17.19). Potable water can be supplied by this desalinator at the rate of 1.25 gallons of water per hour—enough to keep 25 people alive. This compact desalinator, which weighs only 10 pounds, replaces the bulky cases of fresh water formerly stored on Navy life rafts.</p>

<p>As the population of the sunbelt areas of the United States increases, more demand will be placed on the limited supplies of fresh water there. One obvious source of fresh water is from the desalination of seawater. Various schemes have been suggested, including solar evaporation, reverse osmosis, and even a plan for towing icebergs from Antarctica (remember that pure water freezes out of an aqueous solution). The problem, of course, is that all the available processes are expensive. However, as water shortages increase, desalination is becoming necessary. For example, the first full-time public desalination plant is found on Catalina Island, just off the coast of California (Fig. 17.20). This plant, which can produce 132,000 gallons of drinkable water from the Pacific Ocean every day, operates by reverse osmosis. Powerful pumps, developing over 800 lb/in 2 of pressure, are used to force seawater through synthetic semipermeable membranes. Catalina Island’s plant may be just the beginning. The city of Santa Barbara opened a $40 million desalination plant in 1992 that can produce 8 million gallons of drinkable water per day, and the Southern California town of Carlsbad opened a plant in 2012 that can produce 50 million gallons of drinking water from seawater each day. This $320 million project is the largest desalination plant in the Western Hemisphere. Desalination plants are also in the works for Huntington Beach, California, and Camp Pendleton, a military base just north of Carlsbad.</p>
