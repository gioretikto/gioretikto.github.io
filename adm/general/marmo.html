<h1>carbonato di calcio</h1>
      
<p>Calcium carbonate occurs as vast deposits of sedimentary rocks that are formed from the fossilized remains of marine creatures. The most common and stable
form is the hexagonal <i>calcite</i>, which has been identified in numerous different crystalline forms. Calcite comprises about 4 % of the Earth's crust
and is formed in many different geological environments. Calcite can form rocks of considerable mass and constitutes a significant part of all three major
rock classification types: igneous, sedimentary, methamorphic. Calcite is a mojor component in the igneous rock called carbonatite and forms the major
portion of many hydrothermal veins. Limestone is sedimentary form of calcite. 
Limestone metamorphoses to <b>marble</b> from the heat and pressure of metamorphic events, which increase the density of the rock and destroy any texture.
Pure white marble is the result of metamorphism of very pure limestone. The characteristic swirls and veins of many coloured marble varieties are usually due
to various mineral impurities such as clay, silt, sand, and iron oxides. <i>Iceland spar</i> is a form of transparent, colourless calcite originally found
in Iceland. It exhibits birefringence. Birefringence, or double refraction, is the division of a ray of light into two rays when it passes through certain types
of material, depending on the polarization of the light. This behaviour is explained by assigning two different refractive indices to the material for different
polarizations. As the two beams exit the crystal they are ben into two different angles of refraction.</p>

<p><i>Aragonite</i> is a less abundant polymorph of calicte. Aragonite is orthorhombic with three crystal forms. It is less stable than calcite and converts
into it at 400Â°C, given enough time, aragonite in the environment will convert to calcite. Most bivalve animals, such as oysters, clams, mussels and corals,
secrete aragonite and their shells and pearls are composed mostly of aragonite. The parlization and iridiscent colours in seashells such as abalone are due to
several layers of aragonite. Other natural sources of aragonite include hot springs and cavities in volcanic rocks. Synthetic aragonite can be formed and is 
used as a filler in the paper industry, where its fine texture, whiteness, and absorbent properties add quality to the product. Powdered limestone is heated
in a klin to form CaO, lime. The lime is the slurried with water to form <i>milk of lime</i>. Carbon dioxide is the bubbled though the slutty unti aragonite
is formed</p>

<p>CaCo<sub>3</sub> (s)  ----> &Delta; CaO(s) + CO<sub>2</sub> (g)</p>
<p>CaO(s) + H<sub>2</sub> (l) -> Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s)</p>
<p>Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g) -> CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)</p>

<p>The conditions, such as temperature and flow rate of carbon dioxide, determine the final particle size distriburion and crystal type. 
<i>Vaterite</i> is an even rarer polymorph of calcium carbonate, also adopting a hexagonal unit cell. It is more soluble than calcite or aragonite and converts
slowly to these forms in contact with water. It is deposited from some mineral springs in cold climates; gallstones are often composed of this form CaCO<sub>3</sub>
. <i>Travertine</i> is a white, naturally occuring, very hard form of calcium carbonate. It is deposited from the water of hot mineral springs of streams containing
CaO.</p>
