<h1>A Model for Chemical Kinetics - Arrhenius equation</h1>

<p>How do chemical reactions occur? We already have given some indications. For example, we have seen that the rates of chemical reactions depend on the concentrations of the reacting species. The initial rate for the reaction</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>aA + bB ⟶ products</p>
</div>

<p>can be described by the rate law</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Rate = <i>k</i> [A]<sup><i>n</i></sup> [B]<sup><i>m</i></sup></p>
</div>

<p>where the order of each reactant depends on the detailed reaction mechanism. This explains why reaction rates depend on concentration. But what about some of the other actors affecting reaction rates? For example, how does temperature affect the speed of a reaction? We can answer this question qualitatively from our experience. We have refrigerators because food spoilage is retarded at low temperatures. The combustion of wood occurs at a measurable rate only at high temperatures. An egg cooks in boiling water much faster at sea level than in Leadville, Colorado (elevation 10,000 ft), where the
boiling point of water is approximately 90°C. These observations and others lead us to conclude that <b>chemical reactions speed up when the temperature is increased</b>. Experiments have shown that virtually all rate constants show an exponential increase with absolute temperature, as represented in Fig. 11‐9.</p>

<p>In this section we discuss a model used to account for the observed characteristics of reaction rates. This model, called the collision model, is built around the central idea that molecules must collide to react. We have already seen how this assumption explains the concentration dependence of reaction rates. Now we need to consider whether this model can account for the observed temperature dependence of reaction rates. <br> The kinetic molecular theory of gases predicts that an increase in temperature raises molecular velocities and so increases the frequency of collisions between molecules.
This idea agrees with the observation that reaction rates are greater at higher temperatures. Thus there is qualitative agreement between the collision model and experimental observations. However, it is found that the rate of reaction is much smaller than the calculated collision frequency in a collection of gas particles. This must mean that only a small fraction of the collisions produces a reaction. Why?
This question was first addressed in the 1880s by Svante Arrhenius. He proposed the existence of a <i>threshold energy</i>, called the <b>activation energy</b>, that must be overcome to produce a chemical reaction. Such a proposal makes sense, as we can see by considering the decomposition of BrNO in the gas phase:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>2BrNO(g) ⟶ 2NO (g) + Br<sub>2</sub> (g)</p>
</div>

<p>In this reaction two Br−N bonds must be broken and one Br−Br bond must be formed. Breaking a Br−N bond requires considerable energy (243 kJ/mol), which must come from somewhere. The collision model postulates that the energy comes from the kinetic energies possessed by the reacting molecules before the collision. This kinetic energy is changed into potential energy as the molecules are distorted during a collision to break bonds and rearrange the atoms into the product molecules. We can envision the reaction progress as shown in Fig. 11‐10. The arrangement of atoms found at the top of the potential energy “hill,” or barrier, is called the <b>activated complex</b>, or <b>transition state</b>. The conversion of BrNO to NO and Br<sub>2</sub> is exothermic, as indicated by the fact that the products have lower potential energy than the reactant. However, &Delta;<i>E</i> has no effect on the rate of the reaction. Rather, the rate depends on the size of the activation energy <i>E<sub>a</sub></i>. The main point here is that a certain minimum energy is required for two BrNO  molecules to “get over the hill” so that products can form. This energy is furnished by the energy of the collision. A collision between two BrNO molecules with small kinetic energies will not have enough energy to get over the barrier. At a given temperature only a certain fraction of the collisions possesses enough energy to be effective (to result in product formation). <br> We can be more precise by recalling from Chapter 8 that a distribution of velocities exists in a sample of gas molecules. Therefore, a distribution of collision energies also exists, as shown in Fig. 11‐11 for two different temperatures. Figure 11‐11 also shows the activation energy for the reaction in question. Only collisions with energy greater than the activation energy are able to react (get over the barrier). At the lower temperature, T<sub>1</sub>, the fraction of effective collisions is quite small. However, as the temperature is increased to <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>, the fraction of collisions with the required activation energy increases dramatically. When the temperature is doubled, the fraction of effective collisions much more than doubles. In fact, the fraction of effective collisions increases exponentially with temperature. This is encouraging for our theory; remember that rates of reactions are observed to increase exponentially with temperature. Arrhenius postulated that the number of collisions having an energy greater than or equal to the activation energy is given by the expression:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Number of collisions with the activation energy = (total number of collisions) <i>e</i><sup>−<i>E<sub>a</sub></i>/<i>RT</i></sup></p>
</div>

<p>where <i>E<sub>a</sub></i> is the activation energy, <i>R</i> is the universal gas constant, and <i>T</i> is the Kelvin temperature. The factor <i>e</i><sup>−<i>E<sub>a</sub></i>/<i>RT</i></sup> represents the fraction of collisions with energy <i>E<sub>a</sub></i> or greater at temperature <i>T</i>. <br> We have seen that not all molecular collisions are effective in producing chemical reactions because a minimum energy is required for the reaction to occur. There is, however, another complication. Experiments show that the observed reaction rate is considerably smaller than the rate of collisions with enough energy to surmount the barrier. This means that many collisions, even though they have the required energy, still do not produce a reaction. Why not? The answer lies in the <b>molecular orientations</b> during collisions. We can illustrate this using the reaction between two BrNO molecules (Fig. 11‐12). Some collision orientations can lead to reaction, and others cannot. Therefore, we must include a correction factor to allow for collisions with nonproductive molecular orientations. To summarize, two requirements must be satisfied for reactants to collide successfully (to rearrange to form products):</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>The collision must involve enough energy to produce the reaction; that is, the collision energy must equal or exceed the activation energy.</p></li>
	<li><p>The relative orientation of the reactants must allow formation of any new bonds necessary to produce products.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Taking these factors into account, we can represent the rate constant as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>k</i> = <i>zpe</i><sup>−E<sub>a</sub>/RT</sup></p>
</div>

<p>where <i>z</i> is the collision frequency, <i>p </i>is called the <b>steric factor</b> (always less than 1) and reflects the fraction of collisions with effective orientations, and <i>e</i><sup>−E<sub>a</sub>/RT</sup> represents the fraction of collisions with sufficient energy to produce a reaction. This expression is most often written in form</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>k</i> = <i>Ae</i><sup>−E<sub>a</sub>/RT</sup></p>
</div>

<p>which is called the <b>Arrhenius equation</b>. In this equation, A replaces <i>zp</i> and is called the frequency factor for the reaction. <br>Taking the natural logarithm of each side of the Arrhenius equation gives</p>

<p>A linear equation of the type <i>y</i> = <i>mx</i> + <i>b</i>, where <i>y</i> = ln <i>k</i>, <i>m</i> = −<i>E<sub>a</sub></i>/<i>R</i> = slope, <i>x</i> = 1/<i>T</i>, and <i>b</i> = ln <i>A</i> = intercept. Thus for a reaction where the rate constant obeys the Arrhenius equation, a plot of ln <i>k</i> versus 1/<i>T</i> gives a straight line. The slope and intercept can be used to determine, respectively, the values of <i>E<sub>a</sub></i> and <i>A</i> characteristic of that reaction. The fact that most rate constants obey the Arrhenius equation to a good approximation indicates that the collision model for chemical reactions is physically reasonable.</p>
