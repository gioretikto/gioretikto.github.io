<p>The periodic table was originally constructed to represent the patterns observed in the chemical properties of the elements. As chemistry progressed during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it became evident that the earth is composed of a great many elements with very different properties. Things are much more complicated than the simple model of earth, air, fire, and water suggested by the ancients. At first, the array of elements and properties was bewildering. Gradually, however, patterns were noticed. <br> The first chemist to recognize patterns was Johann Dobereiner, who found several groups of three elements with similar properties—for example, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. However, as Dobereiner attempted to expand this model of triads (as he called them) to the rest of the known elements, it became clear that this concept was severely limited. <br>The next notable attempt was made by English chemist John Newlands, who in 1864 suggested that elements should be arranged in octaves. He noticed that certain properties seemed to repeat for every eighth element in a way similar to the musical scale, which repeats for every eighth tone. Although this model managed to group several elements with similar properties, it was not generally successful.<br> The present form of the periodic table was conceived independently by two chemists in 1869: German Julius Lothar Meyer and Russian <a href="../storia/Mendeleev.html">Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev</a>. Usually, Mendeleev is given most of the credit because it was he who showed how useful the table could be in predicting the existence and properties of yet unknown elements. For example, in 1872 when Mendeleev first published his table, the elements gallium, scandium, and germanium were unknown. Mendeleev correctly predicted the existence and properties of these elements from gaps in his periodic table. The data for germanium (which Mendeleev called <i>ekasilicon</i>, «beyond silicon») are shown in Table 12.4. Note the excellent agreement between the actual values and Mendeleev’s predictions, which were based on the properties of other members in the group of elements similar to germanium.</p>

<p>Using his table, Mendeleev was also able to correct several values of atomic masses. For example, the original atomic mass of 76 for indium was based on the assumption that indium oxide had the formula InO. This atomic mass placed indium, which has metallic properties, among the nonmetals. Mendeleev assumed that the atomic mass was probably incorrect and proposed that the formula of indium oxide was really In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. On the basis of this (correct) formula, indium has an atomic mass of about 113, placing the element among the metals. Mendeleev also corrected the atomic masses of beryllium and uranium. <br> Because of its obvious usefulness, Mendeleev’s periodic table was almost universally adopted, and it remains one of the most valuable tools at the chemist’s disposal. For example, it is still used to predict the properties of elements yet to be discovered, as shown in Table 12.5. A current version of the periodic table is shown inside the front cover of this book. The only fundamental difference between this table and that of Mendeleev is that the current table lists the elements in order of atomic number rather than atomic mass. The reason for this will become clear later in this chapter as we explore the electron arrangements of the atom.</p>

<p>Most of the elements are <b>metals</b>. Metals have characteristic physical properties such as efficient conduction of heat and electricity, malleability (they can be hammered into thin sheets), ductility (they can be pulled into wires), and (often) a lustrous appearance. Chemically, metal atoms tend to <i>lose</i> electrons to form positive ions. For example, copper is a typical metal. It is lustrous (although it tarnishes readily); it is an excellent conductor of electricity (it is widely used in electrical wires); and it is readily formed into various shapes such as pipes for water systems. Copper is also found in many salts, such as the beautiful blue copper sulfate, in which copper is present as Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions. Copper is a member of the transition metals—the metals shown in the center of the periodic table. <br> The relatively few <b>nonmetals</b> appear in the upper right-hand corner of the table (to the right of the heavy line in Fig. 2.20), except hydrogen, a nonmetal that is grouped with the metals. The nonmetals typically lack the physical properties that characterize the metals. Chemically, they tend to gain electrons to form anions in reactions with metals. Nonmetals often bond to each other by forming covalent bonds. For example, chlorine is a typical nonmetal. Under normal conditions, it exists as Cl<sup>−</sup> molecules; it reacts with metals to form salts containing Cl<sup>−</sup> ions (NaCl, for example); and it forms covalent bonds with nonmetals (for example, hydrogen chloride gas, or HCl). The periodic table is arranged so that elements in the same vertical columns (called groups or families) have <i>similar chemical properties</i>. For example, all of the alkali metals, members of Group 1A lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), cesium (Cs), and francium (Fr)—are very active elements that readily form ions with a 11 charge when they react with non-metals. The members of Group 2A—beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), and radium (Ra)—are called the <a href="alkali_earth_metals.html">alkaline earth metals</a>. They all form ions with a 21 charge when they react with non-metals. The halogens, the members of Group 7A—fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At)—all form diatomic molecules. Fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine all react with metals to form salts containing ions with a negative charge (F<sup>−</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup>, Br<sup>−</sup>, and I<sup>−</sup>). The members of Group 8A—helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn)—are known as the noble gases. They all exist under normal conditions as monatomic (single-atom) gases and have little chemical reactivity. <br> The horizontal rows of elements in the periodic table are called periods. Horizontal row one is called the first period (it contains H and He), row two is called the second period (elements Li through Ne), and so on. We will learn much more about the periodic table as we continue with our study of chemistry. Meanwhile, when an element is introduced in this text, you should always note its position on the periodic table.</p>

<p>The electron configuration of an element relates to its position in the periodic table. Valence electrons occupy the highest energy (outer) shell. They are the electrons most affected by the approach of another atom. They are the electron most likely to be involved when bonding occurs. Elements with the same number of valence electron will have similar chemical properties, and are arranged underneath one another in Groups.</p>

<p>Electrons can either be core electron or valence electrons. The valence electrons are the outermost electrons of an atom.</p>

</table>

<p>The horizontal rows in the periodic table are called <i>periods</i>. The number of the period being equal to the principal quantum number of the valence shell, the outermost shell of the atom. The periodic table is divided into <i>s, p, d</i>, and <i>f</i> <b>blocks</b>, according to the subshell that is last to be occupied in the formulation of the electronic configuration of the atom. The members of the <i>d</i> block are also known as the <b>transition metals</b>; The elements that correspond to the filling of the 4<i>f</i> and 5<i>f</i> orbitals are listed separately as the <b>lanthanides</b> and <b>actinides</b>, respectively. The heavy black line in separates the metals from the nonmetals, except for one case. Hydrogen, which appears on the metal side, is a nonmetal. Some elements just on either side of this line, such as silicon and germanium, exhibit both metallic and nonmetallic properties. These elements are often called <b>metalloids</b>, or <b>semimetals</b>.</p>

<p>The fundamental chemical difference between metals and nonmetals is that metals tend to lose their valence electrons to form <i>cations</i>, which usually have the valence electron configuration of the noble gas from the preceding period. On the other hand, nonmetals tend to gain electrons to form <i>anions</i> that exhibit the electron configuration of the noble gas in the same period. Metallic character is observed to increase in going down a given group, which is consistent with the trends in ionization energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity discussed earlier. Thus, as we go down in a group of metals, the tendency of their atom to lose electrons increases, and hence their chemical reactivity also increases.</p>
