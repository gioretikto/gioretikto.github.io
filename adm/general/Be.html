<h1>Beryllium</h1>

<p>The others members of the alkaline earth group usually form ionic bonds. Beryllium's covalente bonding is due to the atom's small size compared with the other group members. Only two electrons lie between Beryllium's nucleus and two valence electrons, while ten electrons are between the nucleus and two valence electrons of magnesium, the next element in the group. Beryllium's valence electron are therefore closer to the nucleus than magnesium's and also encounter less interference from inner electrons. These two effects − closeness to the nucleus and less inner-electron interference − help Beryllium keep a tight hold on its valence electrons, so it is not encountered as free ion with two positive charges. The first ionization potential of Beryllium (9.32 eV) is also larger than that of boron (8.30ev) because the boron electron is in the 2<i>p</i> orbital and experiences a greater screening effect from the nuclear charge by the closed 2s shell, which is sufficienlty large to overcome the effect of the increased nuclear charge. The <a href="periodic_table.html#anomalies">atomic radius</a> also explains the amphoteric nature of beryllium oxide (BeO).</p>

<p>High boiling points are one characteristic of ionic compounds. For example, magnesium chloride boils at 1412 °C. Beryllium chloride, on the other hand, vaporizes at 520 °C. The boiling point of BeCl<sub>2</sub> is far lower than expected for an ionic compound, yet large for a covalent one.</p>

<p>Beryllium is a strong neutron reflector and is able to slow down fast neutrons. These properties are used in nuclear fission applications, such as power generation and weapons.</p>

<h2>Uses</h2>

<p>You​ may​ be​ concerned ​if ​your​ physician​ asks​ you​ to ​drink​ a​ “barium ​cocktail” ​to ​check ​the ​condition ​of​ your​ digestive​ tract.​ Don’t​ be​ afraid,​ because ​the ​“cocktail” ​contains​ very ​insoluble ​BaSO<sub>4</sub> ​(K<sub>sp</sub> = 1.1​×​10<suyp>−10</sup>),​so ​it ​passes​ through ​your ​digestive​ tract​ without ​a​ significant​ amount​ being​ absorbed.​ Barium​ sulfate​ is​ opaque​ to​ x-rays,​ so​ its​ path​ through ​your​organs ​appears​ on​ the​ developed ​x-ray ​image.</p>
