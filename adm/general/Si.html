<h1>Silicon</h1>

<p>Silicon is an important constituent of the compounds that make up the earth’s crust. In fact, silicon is to geology what carbon is to biology. Just as carbon compounds are the basis for most biologically significant systems, silicon compounds are fundamental to most of the rocks, sands, and soils found in the earth’s crust. Although carbon and silicon are next to each other in Group 4A of the periodic table, the carbon-based compounds of biology and the silicon-based compounds of geology have markedly different structures. Carbon compounds typically contain long strings of carbon–carbon bonds, but the most stable silicon compounds involve chains with silicon–oxygen bonds. The most important silicon compounds contain silicon and oxygen.</p>

<p>The fundamental silicon–oxygen compound is <b>silica</b>, which has the empirical formula SiO<sub>2</sub>. Knowing the properties of the apparently similar compound carbon dioxide, one might expect silica to be a gas that contains discrete SiO<sub>2</sub> molecules. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth—quartz and some types of sand are typical of the materials composed of silica. What accounts for
this difference? The answer lies in the bonding. Recall that the Lewis structure for CO<sub>2</sub> is O=C=O, and that each C=O bond is described as a combination of a &sigma; bond, involving a carbon <i>sp</i> hybrid orbital, and a &pi; bond, involving a carbon 2<i>p</i> orbital. On the contrary, silicon cannot use its valence 3<i>p</i> orbitals to form strong &pi; bonds to oxygen; the larger size of the silicon atom and its orbitals results in a less effective overlap with the smaller oxygen orbitals. Therefore, instead of forming &pi; bonds, the silicon atom satisfies the octet rule by forming single bonds to four oxygen atoms, as shown in the representation of the structure of quartz in Fig. 1. Note that in this structure each silicon atom is at the center of a tetrahedral arrangement of oxygen atoms, which are shared with other silicon atoms. Although the empirical formula for quartz is SiO<sub>2</sub>, the structure is based on a <i>network</i> of SiO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra with shared oxygen atoms rather than discrete SiO<sub>2</sub> molecules. This means that the hybrid orbitals of Si are <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup>. Thus the differing abilities of carbon and silicon to form &pi; bonds with oxygen have profound effects on the structures and properties of CO<sub>2</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub>. <br>Compounds closely related to silica that are found in most rocks, soils, and clays are the <b>silicates</b>. Like silica, the silicates are based on interconnected SiO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra.</p>

<p>However, in contrast to silica, where the O:Si ratio is 2:1, silicates have O:Si ratios greater than 2;1 and contain silicon–oxygen <i>anions</i>. This means that for the formation of the neutral solid silicates, cations are needed to balance the excess negative charge. In other words, silicates are salts containing metal cations and polyatomic silicon–oxygen anions. Examples of important silicate anions are shown in Fig. 16.30. <br> When silica is heated above its melting point (about 1600°C) and then cooled rapidly, an amorphous solid called a glass results (Fig. 16.31). Note that a glass contains a good deal of disorder, in contrast to the crystalline nature of <b>quartz</b>. Glass more closely resembles a very viscous solution than a crystalline solid. Common glass results when substances such as Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> are added to the silica melt, which is then cooled. The properties of glass can be varied greatly by varying the additives. For example, addition of B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> produces a glass (called borosilicate glass) that expands and contracts little under large temperature changes. Thus it is useful for labware and cooking utensils. The most common brand name for this glass is Pyrex. The addition of K<sub>2</sub>O produces an especially hard glass that can be ground to the precise shapes needed for eyeglasses and contact lenses. The compositions of several types of glass are shown in Table 16.4.</p>

<h2>Ceramics</h2>

<p><b>Ceramics</b> are typically made from clays (which contain silicates) that are hardened by firing at high temperatures. Ceramics are a class of nonmetallic materials that are strong, brittle, and resistant to heat and attack by chemicals. <br>Like glass, ceramics are based on silicates, but with that the resemblance ends. Glass can be melted and remelted as often as desired, but once a ceramic
has been hardened, it is resistant to extremely high temperatures. This behavior results from the very different structures of glasses and ceramics. A glass is a <i>homogeneous</i>, noncrystalline “frozen solution,” whereas a ceramic is <i>heterogeneous</i>. A ceramic contains two phases: minute crystals of silicates that are suspended in a glassy cement.</p>

<p>To understand how ceramics harden, one must know something about the structure of clays. Clays are formed by the weathering action of water and carbon dioxide on the mineral feldspar, which is a mixture of silicates with empirical formulas such as K<sub>2</sub>O ⋅ Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ⋅ 6SiO<sub>2</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>O ⋅ Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ⋅ 6SiO<sub>2</sub>. Feldspar is really an aluminosilicate in which aluminum as well as silicon atoms are part of the oxygen-bridged polyanion. The weathering of feldspar produces kaolinite, consisting of tiny thin platelets with the empirical formula
Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>. When dry, the platelets cling together, but when water is present, they can slide over one another, giving clay its plasticity. As clay dries, the platelets begin to interlock again. When the remaining water is driven off during firing, the silicates and cations form a “glass” that binds the tiny crystals of kaolinite. <br> Ceramics have a very long history. Rocks, which are natural ceramic materials, served as the earliest tools. Later, clay vessels dried in the sun or baked in fires served as containers for food and water. These early vessels were crude and quite porous. With the discovery of glazing, which probably occurred about 3000 B.C. in Egypt, pottery became more serviceable as well as more beautiful. Prized porcelain is essentially the same material as crude earthen- ware, but specially selected clays and glazings are used for porcelain, which is also fired at a very high temperature.</p>
