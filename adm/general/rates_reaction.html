<h1>Rates of Reaction</h1>

<p>When carrying out a chemical reaction, chemists are concerned with two issues: the rate at which the reaction proceeds and the extent to which the reaction is product-favored at equilibrium.. In this chapter, we turn to the first-mentioned question, <b>chemical kinetics</b>, a study of the rates of chemical reactions. The study of kinetics is divided into two parts. The first part is at the macroscopic level, which addresses rates of reactions: what reaction rate means, how to determine a reaction rate experimentally, and how factors such as temperature and the concentrations of reactants influence rates. The second part of this subject considers chemical reactions at the particulate level. Here, the concern is with the <b>reaction mechanism</b>, the detailed pathway taken by atoms and molecules as a reaction proceeds. The goal is to reconcile data in the macroscopic world of chemistry with an understanding of how and why chemical reactions occur at the particulate level—and then to apply this information to control important reactions.</p>

<p>You encounter the concept of rates in many nonchemical circumstances. Common examples are the speed of an automobile, given in terms of the distance traveled per unit time (for example, kilometers per hour) and the rate of flow of water from a faucet, given as volume per unit time (perhaps liters per minute). In each case, a change is measured over an interval of time. Similarly, the rate of a chemical reaction refers to the change in concentration of a reactant or product per unit of time.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Rate of reaction = change in concentration / change in time</p>
</div>

<p>Two measurements are made to determine the average speed of an automobile: distance traveled and time elapsed. Average speed is the distance traveled divided by the time elapsed, or ∆(distance)/∆(time). Average rates of chemical reactions can be determined similarly. Two quantities, concentration and time, are measured. Concentrations can be determined in a variety of ways, such as by using a pH meter to determine the concentration of hydronium ion in a solution or by measuring the absorbance of light by a solution, a property that can be related to the concentration of a species in solution. The average rate of the reaction is the change in the concentration per unit time—that is, ∆(concentration)/∆(time). Let’s consider the decomposition of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> in a solvent. This reaction occurs according to the following equation:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> → 2NO<sub>2</sub> ​+ 1⁄2 O<sub>2</sub></p>
</div>

<p>The rate of this reaction for any interval of time can be expressed as the change in concentration of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> divided by the change in time:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) = Rate of reaction = −∆[N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]/∆<i>t</i></p>
</div>

<p>The minus sign is required because the concentration of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> decreases with time.</p>

<p>During a chemical reaction, amounts of reactants decrease with time, and amounts of products increase. For the decomposition of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, we could also express the rate either as ∆[NO 2 ]/∆<i>t</i> or as ∆[O<sub>2</sub>]/∆<sub>t</sub>. Rates based on changes in concentrations of products will have a positive sign because the concentration is increasing. Furthermore, the numerical values of rates defined in these ways will be different from the value of ∆[N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]/∆<i>t</i>. Note that the rate of decomposition of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> is one half the rate of formation of NO<sub>2</sub> and twice the rate of formation of O<sub>2</sub>. A rate expression relating all of these rates can be determined by dividing each rate expression by the stoichiometric coefficient of the substance in the balanced chemical equation.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) = −∆[N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]/∆<i>t</i> = +1⁄2 ∆[NO<sub>2</sub>]/∆<i>t</i></p>
</div>

<p>The graph of [N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>] versus time in Figure 15.2 does not give a straight line because, as described in Section 15.3, the rate of the reaction changes during the course of the reaction. The concentration of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> decreases rapidly at the beginning of the reaction but more slowly near the end. We can verify this by comparing the rate of disappearance of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> calculated previously (the concentration decreased by 0.12 mol/L in 15 minutes) to the average rate of reaction calculated for the time interval from 6.5 to 9.0 hours (when the concentration drops by 0.12 mol/L in 150 minutes). The average rate in this later stage of this reaction is only one tenth of the previous value.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p<i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) = −∆[N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]/∆<i>t</i> = −[(0 . 10 mol/L ) − (0.22 mol/L)] / (540 m in − 390 min) = +0.12 mol/L / 150 min = 0.00080 mol /L ⋅ min</p>
</div>

<p>The procedure we have used to calculate the reaction rate gives the average rate over the chosen time interval. We might also ask what the instantaneous rate is at a single point in time. In an
automobile, the instantaneous rate can be read from the speedometer. For a chemical reaction, we can extract the instantaneous rate from the concentration–time graph by drawing a line tangent to the concentration–time curve at a particular time. The instantaneous rate is obtained from the slope of this line. </p>

<p>For example, when [N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>] ​= ​0.34 mol/L and <i>t</i> ​= ​5.0 hours, the rate is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Rate when [N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>] is 0.34 M  = −∆[N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]/∆<i>t</i> = +020 mol/L / 140 min = 0.0014 mol /L ⋅ min</p>
</div>

<p>At that particular moment in time, (<i>t</i> ​=  ​5.0 hours), N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> is being consumed at a rate of 0.0014 mol/L ∙ min.</p>
