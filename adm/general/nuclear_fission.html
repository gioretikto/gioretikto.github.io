<h1>Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors</h1>

<p>Nuclear fission was discovered as a result of experiments to produce transuranium elements. Soon after the neutron was discovered in 1932, experimenters realized that this particle, being electrically neutral, should easily penetrate heavy nuclei. They began using neutrons in bombardment reactions, hoping to produce isotopes that would decay to new elements. In 1938, Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and Fritz Strassmann in Berlin identified barium in <a href="U.html">uranium</a> samples that had been bombarded with neutrons. Soon afterward, the presence of barium was explained as a result of fission of the uranium-235 nucleus. <br> When this nucleus is struck by a neutron, it splits into two nuclei.</p>

<p>This process, releases 3.5 x 10<sup>−11</sup> J of energy per event, which translates to 2.1 x 10<sup>13</sup> J per mole of U-235. Compare this figure with that for the combustion of methane, which releases only 8.0 x 10<sup>5</sup> J of energy per mole. The fission of U-235 produces about 26 million times more energy than the combustion of methane.</p>

<p>The process shown above is only one of the many fission reactions that U-235 can undergo. Another is</p>

<p>In fact, over 200 different isotopes of 35 different elements have been observed among the fission products of U-235.</p>

<p>Uranium-235 most easily undergoes fission with slow (sometimes called thermal) neutrons. However, fast neutrons such as those it produces during fission can cause a reaction with uranium-238. In this case <b>the result is not fission</b>. Instead the uranium-238 atom captures the neutron to form uranium-239. This is unstable and rapidly decays, losing a beta particle (an electron) to form neptunium-239; neptunium is also unstable and loses a further beta particle to create plutonium-239.</p>

<p>In the years since 1940, the elements with atomic numbers greater than 92, called the <b>transuranium elements</b>, have been synthesized.</p>

<p>When the uranium-235 nucleus splits, approximately two or three neutrons are released. If the neutrons from each nuclear fission are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, these nuclei split and release even more neutrons. In this way, a chain reaction can occur. A nuclear <b>chain reaction</b> is <i>a self-sustaining series of nuclear fissions caused by the absorption of neutrons released from previous nuclear fissions</i>. The numbers of nuclei that split quickly multiply as a result of the absorption of neutrons released from previous nuclear fissions. Figure 20.19 shows how such a chain reaction occurs. The chain reaction of nuclear fissions is the basis of nuclear power and nuclear weapons.<br> To sustain a chain reaction in a sample of fissionable material, a nucleus that splits must give an average of one neutron that results in the fission of another nucleus, and so on. If the sample is too small, many of the neutrons leave the sample before they have a chance to be absorbed, . There is thus a critical mass for a particular fissionable material, which is the smallest mass of fissionable material in which a chain reaction can be sustained. If the mass is much larger than this (a supercritical mass), the numbers of nuclei that split multiply rapidly. An atomic bomb is detonated with a small amount of chemical explosive that pushes together two or more masses of fissionable material to get a supercritical mass (Figure 20.20). A rapid chain reaction results in the splitting of most of the fissionable nuclei—and in the explosive release of an enormous amount of energy. <br>A <b>nuclear fission reactor</b> is <i>a device that permits a controlled chain reaction of nuclear fissions</i>. In power plants, a nuclear reactor is used to produce heat, which in turn is used to produce steam to drive an electric generator. A nuclear reactor consists of fuel rods alternating with control rods contained within a vessel. The <b>fuel rods</b> are the cylinders that contain fissionable material. In the light-water (ordinary water) reactors commonly used in the United States (see Figure 20.21), these fuel rods contain uranium dioxide pellets in a zirconium alloy tube. Natural uranium contains only 0.72% uranium-235, which is the isotope that undergoes fission. The uranium used for fuel in these reactors is “enriched” so that it contains about 3% of the uranium-235 isotope. <b>Control rods</b> are <i>cylinders composed of substances that absorb neutrons, such as boron and cadmium, and can therefore slow the chain reaction</i>. By varying the depth of the control rods within the fuel-rod assembly (reactor core), one can increase or decrease the absorption of neutrons. If necessary, these rods can be dropped all the way into the fuel-rod assembly to stop the chain reaction.</p>

<figcaption>An <b>atomic bomb</b> In the gun-type bomb, one piece of uranium-235 of subcritical mass is hurled into another piece by a chemical explosive. The two pieces together give a supercritical
mass, and a nuclear explosion results. Bombs using plutonium-239 require an implosion technique, in which wedges of plutonium arranged on a spherical surface are pushed into the center of the sphere by
a chemical explosive, where a supercritical mass of plutonium results in a nuclear explosion.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A <b>moderator</b>, a <i>substance that slows down neutrons</i>, is required if uranium-235 is the fuel and this isotope is present as a small fraction of the total fuel. The neutrons that are released by the splitting of uranium-235 nuclei are absorbed more readily by uranium-238 than by other uranium-235 nuclei. However, when the neutrons are slowed down by a moderator, they are more readily absorbed by
uranium-235, so it is possible to sustain a chain reaction with low fractional abundance of this isotope. Commonly used moderators are heavy water (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">  <msubsup>    <mi></mi>    <mn>1</mn>    <mn>2</mn>  </msubsup>  <msub>    <mtext>H</mtext>    <mn>2</mn>  </msub>  <mtext>O</mtext></math>), light water, and graphite. <br>In the light-water reactor, ordinary water acts as both a moderator and a coolant. Figure 20.21 shows a pressurized-water design of this type of reactor. Water in the reactor is maintained at about 350°C under high pressure (150 atm) so it does not boil. The hot water is circulated to a heat exchanger, where the heat is used to produce steam to run a turbine and generate electricity. <br>After a period of time, fission products that absorb neutrons accumulate in the fuel rods. This interferes with the chain reaction, so eventually the fuel rods must be replaced. Originally, the intention was to send these fuel rods to <i>reprocessing plants</i>, where fuel material could be chemically separated from the radioactive wastes. Opposition to constructing these plants has been intense, however. Plutonium-239 would be one of the fuel materials separated from the spent fuel rods. This isotope is produced during the operation of the reactor when uranium-238 is bombarded with neutrons. It is fissionable and can be used to construct atomic bombs. For this reason, many people believe that the availability of this element in large quantities would increase the chance that many countries and terrorist groups could divert enough plutonium to produce atomic bombs. <br>Whether or not the spent fuel rods are reprocessed, a pressing problem facing the nuclear power industry is how to dispose of radioactive wastes safely. One of many proposals is to encase the waste in a ceramic material and store the solids deep in the earth, perhaps in salt mines.</p>

<figcaption><b>Light-water nuclear reactor</b>. The nuclear reactor consists of fuel rods with interspersed control rods. By raising or lowering the control rods, an operator can increase or decrease the rate of energy release from the fuel rods. Heat from the fuel rods raises the temperature of the liquid water in the reactor. A pump circulates the hot water to a steam generator, and the resulting steam passes through a turbine that operates an electric generator. The steam leaves the turbine and goes into the condenser, where it liquefies on the cooling coil. A nearby river or lake provides the cold water for the condenser.</figcaption>

<h2>Breeder Reactors</h2>

<p>The next transuranium element to be discovered was plutonium (Z = 94). Deuterons, the positively charged nuclei of hydrogen-2, were accelerated by a cyclotron and directed at a uranium target to give neptunium-238, which decayed to plutonium-238.</p>

<p>One potential problem facing the nuclear power industry is the supply of U-235. Some scientists have suggested that we have nearly depleted those uranium deposits rich enough in U-235 to make production of fissionable fuel economically feasible. The two main, fertile, isotopes that are useful for this purpose are uranium-238 that will generate fissile plutonium and thorium-232 that will produce fissile uranium. Because of this possibility, <b>breeder reactors</b> have been developed, in which fissionable fuel is actually ­produced while the reactor runs. In the breeder reactors now being studied, the major component of natural uranium, nonfissionable U-238, is changed to fissionable Pu-239. The reaction involves absorption of a neutron, followed by production of two &beta; particles:</p>

<p>As the reactor runs and U-235 is split, some of the excess neutrons are absorbed by U-239 to produce Pu-239. The Pu-239 is then separated out and used to fuel another reactor. Such a reactor thus “breeds” nuclear fuel as it operates. <br>Although breeder reactors are now used in France, the United States is proceeding slowly with their development because of their controversial nature. One problem involves the hazards in handling plutonium, which flames on contact with air and is very toxic.</p>
