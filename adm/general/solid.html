<h1>Classification of Solids by Type of Attraction of Units</h1>

<p>A solid consists of structural units—atoms, molecules, or ions—that are attracted to one another strongly enough to give a rigid substance. One way to classify solids is by the type of force holding the structural units together. In some cases, these forces are intermolecular and hold molecules together. In other cases, these forces are chemical bonds (metallic, ionic, or covalent) and hold atoms together. From this point of view, then, there are four different types of solids: molecular, metallic, ionic, and covalent. It should be noted, however, that a given ionic bond may have considerable covalent character, and vice versa, so the distinction between ionic and covalent solids is not a precise one.</p>

<h2>Types of Solids</h2>

<p>A <b>molecular solid</b> is a solid that consists of atoms or molecules held together by intermolecular forces. Many solids are of this type. Examples include solid neon, solid water (ice), and solid carbon dioxide (dry ice).<br> A <b>metallic solid</b> is a solid that consists of positive cores of atoms held together by a surrounding “sea” of electrons (metallic bonding). In this kind of bonding, positively charged atomic cores are surrounded by delocalized electrons. Examples include iron, copper, and silver.<br> An <b>ionic solid</b> is a solid that consists of cations and anions held together by the electrical attraction of opposite charges (ionic bonds). Examples are cesium chloride, sodium chloride, and zinc sulfide (but ZnS has considerable covalent character). A <b>covalent network solid</b> is a solid that consists of atoms held together in large networks or chains by covalent bonds. Diamond is an example of a three-dimensional network solid. Every carbon atom in diamond is covalently bonded to four others, so an entire crystal might be considered an immense molecule. It is possible to have similar two-dimensional “sheet” and one-dimensional “chain” molecules, with atoms held together by covalent bonds. Examples are diamond (three-dimensional network), graphite (sheets), and asbestos (chains). Figure 11.28 shows the structures of diamond and graphite. Table 11.4 summarizes these four types of solids.</p>

<h2>Physical Properties</h2>

<p>Many physical properties of a solid can be directly related to its structure. Let us look at several of these properties.</p>

<h2>Melting Point and Structure</h2>

<p>Table 11.1 lists the melting points for various solids and also gives the type of solid. For a solid to melt, the forces holding the structural units in their sites must be overcome, at least partially. In a molecular solid, these forces are weak intermolecular attractions. Thus, molecular solids tend to have low melting points (usually below 300°C). At room temperature, many molecular substances are either liquids (such as water and ethanol) or gases (such as carbon dioxide and ammonia). Note also that the melting points of molecular solids reflect the strengths of intermolecular attractions, just as boiling points do. This can be seen in the melting points of the molecular solids listed in Table 11.1. <br>For ionic solids and covalent network solids to melt, chemical bonds must be broken. For that reason, the melting points of these types of solids are relatively high. The melting point of the ionic solid sodium chloride is 801°C; that of magnesium oxide is 2800°C. Melting points of covalent network solids are generally quite high. Quartz, for example, melts at 1610°C; diamond, at 3550°C. See Table 11.1. <br>The difference between the melting points of sodium chloride (801°C) and magnesium oxide (2800°C) can be explained in terms of the charges on the ions. You expect the melting point to rise with lattice energy. Lattice energies, however, depend on the product of the ionic charges (and inversely on the distance between charges). For sodium chloride (Na<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup>) this ion-charge product is (+1) x (−1) = −1, whereas for magnesium oxide (Mg<sup>2+</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>2−</sup>) it is (+2) x (−2) = −4. Thus, the lattice energy is greater for magnesium oxide, and this is reflected in its much higher melting point. <br> Metals often have high melting points, but there is considerable variability. Mercury, a liquid at room temperature, melts at −39°C. Tungsten melts at 3410°C, the highest melting point of any metallic element. In general, melting points are low for the Group IA and IIA elements but increase as you move right in the periodic table to the transition metals. The elements in the center of the transition series (such as tungsten) have high melting points. Then, as you move farther to the right, the melting points decrease and are again low for the Group IIB elements.</p>

<h2>Hardness and Structure</h2>

<p>Hardness depends on how easily the structural units of a solid can be moved relative to one another and therefore on the strength of attractive forces between the units. Thus, molecular crystals, with weak intermolecular forces, are rather soft compared with ionic crystals, in which the attractive forces are much stronger. A three-dimensional covalent network solid is usually quite hard because of the rigidity given to the structure by strong covalent bonds throughout it. Diamond and silicon carbide (SiC), three-dimensional covalent networks, are among the hardest substances known. <br> We should add that molecular and ionic crystals are generally brittle because they fracture easily along crystal planes. Metallic crystals, by contrast, are <i>malleable</i>; that is, they can be shaped by hammering (Figure 11.29). Hardness and Structure One of the characteristic properties of metals is good electrical conductivity. The delocalized valence electrons are easily moved by an electrical field and are responsible for carrying the electric current. By contrast, most covalent and ionic solids are nonconductors, because the electrons are localized to particular atoms or bonds. Ionic substances do become conducting in the liquid state, however, because the ions can move. In an ionic liquid, it is the ions that carry the electric current. <br>Table 11.5 summarizes the properties we discussed for the different types of
solids.</p>
