<h1>Molecular Orbital theory</h1>

<p>MO theory proposed by Hund an Mulliken in 1932 explains the formation of a covalent bond in a better way than <a href="VB.html">VB theory</a>. An electron in a atom is described by a wave function <i>&psi;</i>, called an <i>atomic orbital</i>. Similarly, the behaviour of an electron in a molecule is described by a molecular wave function called <i>molecular orbital</i>. The most convenient way of working out the wave functions for molecular orbitals is to adopt the method of the <i>linear combination of atomic orbital</i> (LCAO).</p>

<p>Quantum mechanics show that linear combination of two functions gives not one but two combinations and hence two molecular orbitals, a bonding and an antibondig orbital. <br> If <i>&psi;<sub>A</sub></i> and <i>&psi;<sub>B</sub></i> are atomic wave functions of the combining atoms A and B, then the wave fcuntions of orbitals can be obtained by the <i>addition</i> or <i>subtraction</i> of the wave functions, of the two atomic orbitals.</p>

<p>Thus the wave function of bonding orbital is given as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&Psi;<sub>+</sub></i> = <i>&psi;<sub>A</sub></i> + <i>&psi;<sub>B</sub></i> &emsp; (legante)</p>
<p><i>&Psi;<sub>−</sub></i> = <i>&psi;<sub>A</sub></i> − <i>&psi;<sub>B</sub></i>&emsp; (antilegante)</p>
</div>

<p>For the atomic orbitals to combine and form molecular orbitals, the following conditions must be satisfied:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>The combining orbitals should be of a comparable energy. For example, 1<i>s</i> atomic orbitals of two atoms can combine but 1<i>s</i> orbital of one atom cannot combine with 2<i>s</i> orbital of the other.<br> Similarly 2<i>s</i> orbitals cannot combine with 2<i>p</i> orbital. Such combination are possible only for the heteronuclear diatomic molecular type.</p></li>
	
	<li><p>The combining atomic orbitals must overlap to a large extent: greater the overlap, stable is the molecular formed. The combining atomic orbitals must have proper orientation so that they are able to overlap to a considerable extent.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>Nonbonding orbitals</b> are also possible. The energy of a nonbonding orbital is essentially that of an atomic orbital, either because the orbital on one atom has a symmetry that does not match any orbitals on the other atom or the orbital on one atom has a severe energy mismatch with symmetry-compatible orbitals on the other atom. </p>

<p><i>p<sub>y</sub></i> and <i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbitals will combine as they have same symmetry about <i>x</i> axis. <i>p<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbitals will not combine as they do not have symmetry about <i>x</i> axis.</p>

<p>Considering the <i>bonding molecular orbital</i>, &Psi;<sub>+</sub> the electron density probability of the bonding molecular orbital is:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&Psi;<sub>+</sub><sup>2</sup> = (&psi;<sub>A</sub> + &psi;<sub>B</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = &psi;<sub>A</sub><sup>2</sup> + &psi;<sub>B</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2&psi;<sub>A</sub>&psi;<sub>B</sub></i></p>
</div>

<p>A <i>sigma</i> (&sigma;) orbital is one that has cylindrical symmetry around the internuclear axis, i.e., it does not show any change of sign or rotation through 180° about the axis. Alternatively, it can be said that a sigma molecular orbital has no nodal plane (in which the electron density is zero) along the internuclear axis. The bonding orbital is designated as <i>&sigma;</i> orbital and antibonding as <i>&sigma;</i>*.</p>

<p>When atomic orbitals overlap laterally (side-to-side), the resulting orbital is called a pi (&pi;) orbital. A &pi; type orbital does not possess cyclindrical symmetry about the internuclear axis, i.e. if we rotate this molecular orbitals through 180°, it will change sign. In contrast to &sigma;-orbital, &pi;-MO has a nodal plane (zero electron density) along the internuclear axis.</p>

<p>The energies of the two molecular orbitals of H<sub>2</sub>, are depicted in Fig.1. The two electrons occupy the lower energy molecular orbital. The H<sub>2</sub> molecule has a lower energy than that of the separated atoms because two electron can occupy the orbital &Psi;<sub>+</sub> and both can contribute to the lowering of its energy. A weaker bond can be expected if only one electron is present in a bonding orbital, but nevertheless H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> is known as a transient gas-phase ion; its dissociation energy is 2.6 eV (250 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>). Three electron (as in H<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>) are less effective than two electron because the third electron must occupy the antibonding orbital &Psi;<sub>-</sub> and hence destabilize the molecule. With four electrons, the antibonding effect of two electrons in &Psi;<sub>−</sub> overcomes the bonding effect of two electrons in &Psi;<sub>+</sub>. There is then no net bonding. It follows that a four-electron molecule with only 1<i>s</i> orbitals available for bond formation, such as He<sub>2</sub>, is not expected to be stable relative to dissociation into its atoms.</p>

<p>An indication of the size of the energy gap between the two molecular orbitals is the observation of a spectroscopic absorption in H<sub>2</sub> at 11.4 eV (in the ultraviolet at 109 nm), which can be ascribed to the transition of an electron from the bonding orbital to the antibonding orbital. The dissociation energy of H<sub>2</sub> is 4.5 eV .</p>

<p>Orbitals are classified as <b>g</b> for <i>gerade</i> or <b>u</b> for <i>ungerade</i> according to their symmetry with respect to inversion.</p>

<p>it is well known experimentally that the O<sub>2</sub> molecule is paramagnetic and has a magnetic moment corresponding to two unpaired electrons. Liquid state O<sub>2</sub> is paramagnetic hence gets attracted to a strong magnet. Notice that valence bond theory and Lewis dot structures do not explain why liquid oxygen is paramagnetic.</p>
