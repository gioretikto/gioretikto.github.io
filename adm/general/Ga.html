<h1>Gallium</h1>

<p>Gallium has a melting point of 29.8 °C. Your normal body temperature is 37 °C. As this is higher than gallium’s melting point, the metal will melt in your hand. Because gallium is a liquid over an unusually large temperature range, it makes a perfect working liquid for a thermometer. Just as in mercury thermometers, which have mostly been phased out because of the toxicity of mercury, the gallium expands as the temperature increases. Threfore, gallium moves up the tube as the temperature increases.</p>
