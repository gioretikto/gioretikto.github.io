<h1>Hg mercurio</h1>

<p><b>Configurazione elettronica</b>: [Xe]4f<sup>14</sup>5d<sup>10</sup>6s<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><b>Struttura cristallina</b>: romboedrica</p>
<p><b>Punto di fusione</b>:  234,32 K (-38,83 °C)</p>
<p><b>Punto di ebollizione</b>:	629,88 K (356,73 °C)</p>
<p><b>Densità liquido</b>: 13,53 g/cm³;</p>

<p>A complete explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves deep into the realm of quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells. Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gases, which form weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures.</p>

<p>The stability of the 6s shell is due to the presence of a filled 4f shell. An f shell poorly screens the nuclear charge that increases the attractive Coulomb interaction of the 6s shell and the nucleus (see lanthanide contraction). The absence of a filled inner f shell is the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc, although both these metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points.</p>

<h2>Why Is Mercury a Liquid?</h2>

<p>Electrons moving at a speed close to the speed of light cannot be treated in terms of classical physics, but they are assigned a relativistic mass that is larger than the mass of the electron at rest.
In the orbital closest to the nucleus, the electrons have to move at a fast speed. They move at a roughly 1/2 the speed of light to avoid being dragged into the nucleus by the powerful positive charge of the nucleus.</p>

<p>How does relativity explain why mercury has a melting point of −39°C, whereas that of neighboring gold is 1064°C? The first step in answering this question involves considering the electron configurations of these atoms:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Au: [Xe]4f<sup>14</sup> 5d<sup>10</sup> 6s<sup>1</sup><br>
Hg: [Xe]4f<sup>14</sup> 5d<sup>10</sup> 6s<sup>2</sup></p>
</div>

<p>The relativistif effect exists in all atoms, but only becomes significant when the atomic number <i>Z</i> exceeds about 50 (Sn). It increases roughly as <i>Z</i><sup>2</sup>, and for gold (Z = 79) and mercury (Z = 80) the 1<i>s</i> electrons have speeds of about 58% of that of light, and their mass is thereby increased by about 20%. The 1<i>s</i> orbital therefore shrinks, and the <i>s</i> orbitals of higher quantum number have to contract in accordance; in fact the 6<i>s</i> orbital shrinks relatevely more than the 1<i>s</i>. The same effect also operates to a lesser extent on the <i>p</i> electrons, but <i>d</i> and <i>f</i> electrons are hardly affected, never coming close to the nucleus due to the centrifugal potential <i>l</i>(<i>l</i> +1)/<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>, <i>l</i> being the azimuthal quantum number and <i>r</i> the radius. In addition their effective potential is more efficiently screened because of the relative contractions of the <i>s</i> and <i>p</i> shells: they therefore increase in energy and move outwards, this effect being called the <i>indirect relativistic orbital expansion</i>.</p>

<p>Notice that gold has an unfilled 6s subshell, but the 6<i>s</i> level is filled in mercury. According to Bohr's model gold has on electron in its outer shell and it should be hihgly reactive like calcium and lithium, but it is not. This is beacause heavier electron of gold are held closer to the atomic nucleus. This ensures that other atoms don't affect these electrons much. 
In gold, 6<i>s</i> orbital contraction and 5<i>d</i> orbital expansion reduce the energy gap between the 6<i>s</i> and 5<i>d</i> orbitals, which shifts absorption for the 5<i>d</i> orbital to the 6<i>s</i> transitio ot relatively smaller energies up to yellow visible light.</p>

<p>Because of its configuration, a gold atom can use its half-filled 6<i>s</i> orbital to form a bond to another gold atom. In fact, the metal–metal bond in the Au 2 molecule is an astonishingly strong 221 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>, a value very close to the bond energy of the Cl<sub>2</sub> molecule (239 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>) and greater than the bond energy of I<sub>2</sub> (149 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>). In addition, gold has an electron affinity (2220 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>) that is higher than that of oxygen and sulfur. Further, gold forms a compound with cesium (CsAu) that exhibits the CsCl crystal structure in which gold atoms take the place of Cl<sub>2</sub> ions. Thus a gold atom seems to behave a lot like a halogen atom. </p>

<p>Contraction of the 6<i>s</i> orbital in Hg leads to a lowerint of bonding interaction between Hg atoms, resulting in reameaning a liquid down to low temperatures and a monomer in gaseuous form. Unlike gold, the low-energy 6<i>s</i> orbital in mercury is filled, and these two electrons are very tightly bound to the mercury atom. In fact, one can think of Hg as being analogous to He. That is, the low-energy pair of 6<i>s</i> electrons on mercury causes it to behave like a noble gas atom—it cannot bond to another mercury atom. This explains why mercury is unique among metals in that it is almost entirely monomeric in its gas phase. In contrast, the species Hg<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup> is extremely stable even in aqueous solution. This fact is not surprising once it is realized that Hg<sup>+</sup> is isoelectronic with Au. Thus it is the unusually low energy of the 6<i>s</i> orbitals apparently caused by relativistic effects that causes gold to behave like a halogen atom and mercury to behave like a noble gas (noble liquid).</p>

<h2>Amalgams</h2>

<p>Mercury dissolves many metals such as gold and silver to form amalgams. Iron is an exception, and iron flasks have traditionally been used to trade mercury. Several other first row transition metals with the exception of manganese, copper and zinc are also resistant in forming amalgams. Other elements that do not readily form amalgams with mercury include platinum.[12][13] Sodium amalgam is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis, and is also used in high-pressure sodium lamps.</p>

<p>Mercury readily combines with aluminium to form a mercury-aluminium amalgam when the two pure metals come into contact. Since the amalgam destroys the aluminium oxide layer which protects metallic aluminium from oxidizing in-depth (as in iron rusting), even small amounts of mercury can seriously corrode aluminium. For this reason, mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.</p>

<p>Mercury embrittlement is the most common type of liquid metal embrittlement.</p>
      
<p>Mercury does not wet glass, and it is for this reason that its surface, or <i>meniscus</i>, in a thermometer is concave towards the mercury side; it bulges outwards. Water wets glass because of the electric attractions between its molecules and htose of the silica in the glass, and its meniscus is convex towards the water side; it bulges inwards. In a tube of sufficiently narrow bore, the inter-phase forces at the meniscus are capable of supporting the weight of a column of the liquid. The smaller the diameter, the longer is the colums supported, the phenomenon being known as <i>capillarity</i>, form the Latin word <i>capillus</i>, meaning hair, and emphasizing the required finess. Capilarrity is extremenly important in plant life, the very thin vascular systems being capable of drawing up threads of liquid through considerable distances.</p>
