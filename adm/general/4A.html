<h1>The Group 4A Elements</h1>

<p>Group 4A (with the valence electron configuration ns<sup>2</sup>np<i>2</i>) contains two of the most important elements on earth: carbon, the fundamental constituent of the molecules necessary for life, and silicon, which forms the basis of the geological world. The change from nonmetallic to metallic properties seen in Group 3A is also apparent in going down Group 4A from carbon, a typical nonmetal,
to silicon and germanium, usually considered semimetals, to the metals tin and lead. Table 18.10 summarizes some physical properties, sources, and methods of preparation of the elements in this group. <br> All the Group 4A elements can form four covalent bonds to nonmetals— for example, CH<sub>4</sub>, SiF<sub>4</sub>, GeBr<sub>4</sub>, SnCl<sub>4</sub>, and PbCl<sub>4</sub>. In each of these tetrahedral molecules, the central atom is described as sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized by the localized electron model. <br> We have seen that carbon also differs markedly from the other members of Group 4A in its ability to form p bonds. This accounts for the completely different structures and properties of CO<sub>2</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub>. Note from Table 18.11 that C−C bonds and Si−O bonds are stronger than Si−Si bonds. This partly explains why the chemistry of carbon is dominated by C−C bonds, whereas that of silicon is dominated by Si−O bonds. <br> Carbon occurs in the allotropic forms graphite, diamond, and fullerenes, whose structures were given in Section 16.5. The most important chemistry of carbon is organic chemistry, which is described in detail in Chapter 21. <br>
<i>Silicon</i>, the second most abundant element in the earth’s crust, is a semimetal found widely distributed in silica and silicates (see Section 16.5). About 85% of the earth’s crust is composed of these substances. Although silicon is found in some steel and aluminum alloys, its major use is in semiconductors for electronic devices (see Chapter 16). <br> <i>Germanium</i>, a relatively rare element, is a semimetal used mainly in the manufacture of semiconductors for transistors and similar electronic devices. <br> <i>Tin</i> is a soft, silvery metal that can be rolled into thin sheets (tin foil) and has been used for centuries in various alloys such as bronze (20% Sn and 80% Cu), solder (33% Sn and 67% Pb), and pewter (85% Sn, 7% Cu, 6% Bi, and 2% Sb). Tin exists as three allotropes: white tin, stable at normal temperatures; gray tin, stable at temperatures below 13.28C; and <i>brittle tin</i>, found at temperatures above 161°C. When tin is exposed to low temperatures, it gradually changes to powdery gray tin and crumbles away; this is known as <i>tin disease</i>. <br>Currently, tin is used mainly as a protective coating for steel, especially for cans used as food containers. The thin layer of tin, applied electrolytically, forms a protective oxide coating that prevents further corrosion. <br> <i>Lead</i> is easily obtained from its ore, galena (PbS). Because lead melts at such a low temperature, it may have been the first pure metal obtained from its ore. We know that lead was used as early as 3000 b.c. by the Egyptians. It was later used by the Romans to make eating utensils, glazes on pottery, and even intricate plumbing systems. The Romans also prepared a sweetener called sapa by boiling down grape juice in lead-lined vessels. The sweetness of this syrup was partly caused by the formation of lead(II) acetate (formerly called sugar of lead), a very sweet-tasting compound. The problem with these practices is that lead is very toxic. In fact, the Romans had so much contact with lead that it may have contributed to the demise of their civilization. Analysis of bones from that era shows significant levels of lead. Although lead poisoning has been known since at least the second century b.c., lead continues to be a problem. For example, many children have been exposed to lead by eating chips of lead-based paint. Because of this problem, lead-based paints are no longer used for children’s furniture, and many states have banned lead-based paint for interior use. Lead poisoning can also occur when acidic foods and drinks leach the lead from lead-glazed pottery dishes that were improperly fired and when liquor is stored in leaded crystal decanters, producing toxic levels of lead in the drink in a relatively short time. In addition, the widespread use of tetraethyl lead [(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>Pb] as an antiknock agent in gasoline has increased the lead levels in our environment. Concern about the effects of this lead pollution has caused the U.S. government to require the gradual replacement of the lead in gasoline with other antiknock agents. The largest commercial use of lead (over one million tons annually) is for electrodes in the lead storage batteries used in automobiles (see Section 11.5).
