<h1>Crystalline Solids; Crystal Lattices and Unit Cells</h1>

<p>Crystals are solids that possess long-range order. The arrangement of the atoms at one point in a crystal is identical, (excepting localised mistakes or defects that can arise during crystal growth), to that in any other remote part of the crystal. Crystallography describes the ways in which the component atoms are arranged in crystals and how the long-range order is achieved. Many chemical (including biochemical) and physical properties depend on crystal structure and knowledge of crystallography is essential if the properties of materials are to be understood and exploited.</p>

<p>Early crystallographers always thought that external geometry arose out of a regularity in the arrangement of atoms or molecules within the crystal. Although the concept of atoms and molecules came much later, the thinking of the early crystallographers was directed in terms of what are known as the building blocks. The idea originated from the observation by Huygens that a calcite crystal when parted, breaks into tiny rhombic prisms of the same geoemtry. One can similaryly observe that a halite crystal parts into tiny cubes. This concept was further developed by Haüy who proposed that the building blocks be replaced by <i>spheres</i> which, in turn, are thought to represent atoms or molecules. </p>

<p>Crystal structures are depicted in terms of a <i>lattice</i>, that is an infinite array of points arranged in such a way that if you were able to stand on one of these points, no matter which of the points you chose to spep onto, your surroundings would look exactly the same. <br>If one lattice point is arbitrarly chosen as the origin, the vector <i><b>r</b></i> between this origin and any other point is given by</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i><b>r</b></i> = <i>u</i><sub>1</sub><b><i>a</i></b> + <i>u</i><sub>2</sub><b><i>b</i></b>+ <i>u</i><sub>3</sub><b><i>c</i></b>&emsp; (2.1)</p>
</div>

<p>where <i>u</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>u</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>u</i><sub>3</sub>, are integers thatn can take any value − positive or negative −and <i><b>a, b</b></i> and <i><b>c</b></i> are <b>basis vectors</b> pointing in three different directions in space, respectively, so that the lattice is 3D. <br> As every single lattice point can be reached by putting all possitble values of <i>u</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>u</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>u</i><sub>3</sub> into eq (2.1), this equation helps descrive a lattice mathematically.</p>

<p>In geThe vectors <b><i>a,b</i></b> and <b><i>c</i></b> may have equal magnitude or different and make a different angle, <i>&alpha;</i>, with each other. In two dimensions, <i><b>a,</b></i> define a paralleloragram, representing the <b>unit cell</b> of the lattice, with sides of length <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. Despite the multiplicity of possible unit cells, only five unique two-dimensional or <b>plane lattices</b> are possible.</p>

<p>In 1848, the French physicist August Bravais showed that there are 14 different kinds of lattices in 3D lattices, known as <b>Bravais lattices</b>. The unit cells of the 14 Bravais lattices are shown in Fig. 23.7. The 14 Bravais lattices are grouped into the seven <b>crystal systems</b>, based on unit-cell symmetry.</p>

<p>Unit cells that have lattice points only at their corners are called <b>primitive</b> (or <b>simple</b>) unit cells. Seven of the Bravais lattices have primitive (P) unit cells. A body-centered lattice (denoted by the letter I, from the German <i>innenzentrierte</i>) has a lattice point within the unit cell as well as at each corner of the unit cell. A <b>face-centered</b> (F) lattice has a lattice point on each of the six unit-cell faces as well as at the corners. The letter C denotes an <b>end-centered</b> lattice with a lattice point on each of the two faces bounded by edges of lengths <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. The letters A and B have similar meanings. <br>Each point at a unit-cell corner is shared among eight adjacent unit cells in the lattice—four at the same level (Fig. 23.8) and four immediately above or below. Therefore a primitive unit cell has 8/8 = 1 lattice point and 1 basis group per unit cell. Each point on a unit-cell face is shared between two unit cells, so an F unit cell has 8/8 + 6/2 = 4 lattice points and 4 basis groups per unit cell. <br> One could use a primitive unit cell to describe any crystal structure, but since in many cases this cell would have less symmetry than a cell of a (nonprimitive) centered lattice, it is more convenient to use the centered lattice. For example, Fig. 23.9 shows a two-dimensional lattice broken into centered unit cells and into less symmetric primitive unit cells.</p>

<p>Solids can be crystalline or amorphous. A <b>crystalline solid</b> is composed of one or more crystals; each crystal has a well-defined ordered structure in three dimensions. Sodium chloride (table salt) and sucrose (table sugar) are examples of crystalline substances. Metals are usually compact masses of crystals. An <b>amorphous solid</b> has a disordered structure; it lacks the well-defined arrangement of basic units (atoms, molecules, or ions) found in a crystal. A glass is an amorphous solid obtained by cooling a liquid rapidly enough that its basic units are “frozen” in random positions before they can assume an ordered crystalline arrangement. Common window glass is an example, as is obsidian, a natural glass formed when molten rock from a volcanic eruption cools quickly</p>

<div class="def">
<p><b>Ordinary glass</b>. When quartz crystals (SiO<sub>2</sub>) are melted and then cooled rapidly, they form a glass called silica glass. Though ideal for some purposes, silica glass is difficult to work with because of its high temperature of softening. This temperature can be lowered by adding various oxides, such as Na<sub>2</sub>O and CaO. In practice, ordinary glass is formed by melting sand (quartz crystals) with sodium carbonate and calcium carbonate. The carbonates decompose to the oxides plus carbon dioxide.</p>

<h2>Crystal Lattices</h2>

<p>A crystal is a three-dimensional ordered arrangement of basic units. (The basic unit may be an atom, molecule, or ion, depending on the type of crystal.) The ordered structure of a crystal is conveniently described in terms of a <i>crystal lattice</i>. The idea of a crystal lattice is most easily grasped by looking at two-dimensional repeating patterns such as those seen on many fabrics or wallpapers. For simplicity, consider the pattern of A’s shown in Figure 11.30A. This pattern consists of a repetition of basic units A. A lattice of points is obtained by choosing the same point in each basic unit. (The choice of this point is immaterial as long as the same point is chosen in each basic unit.) In the pattern of Figure 11.30, we have chosen the points to be midway on the crossbar of each A. The collection of these points constitutes the lattice of the pattern (Figure 11.30B). This lattice shows the essential arrangement of the basic units (A’s) in the pattern. We could have chosen a different location for the point in each A, but we would have obtained the same lattice.<br> Similarly, we define a <b>crystal lattice</b> as the geometric arrangement of lattice points of a crystal, in which we choose one lattice point at the same location within each of the basic units of the crystal. Figure 11.31 shows the crystal structure of copper metal. If we place a point at the same location in each copper atom (say at the center of the atom), we obtain the crystal lattice for copper. The crystal lattice and crystal structure are not the same. We can imagine building the crystal structure for copper from
its crystal lattice by placing a copper atom at each lattice point. Many different crystals have the same crystal lattice. For instance, the crystal lattice for solid methane, CH<sub>4</sub>, is the same (except for the distances between points) as that for copper. We obtain the methane crystal structure by placing CH<sub>4</sub> molecules at the lattice points.</p>

<p>From this arrangement, we can see that the crystal possesses a periodic structure, and we should take advantage of this periodicity to describe its structure. We define a <i>unit cell</i> to be the smallest collection of atoms (or molecules) in the crystal such that the replication of the unit cell in three dimensions generates the entire crystal. In other words, we will describe the crystal by a repeating pattern of unit cells. Figure 29.2 illustrates in two dimensions how a unit cell can generate a crystal lattice. Clearly, a unit cell cannot have any arbitrary shape. For example, we cannot have a spherical unit cell because there would be gaps between the spheres when this unit cell is replicated in three dimensions. It is also impossible to generate a crystal lattice by a unit cell that has a five-fold symmetry axis (Problem 29-43). The unit cell must be a geometric structure that fills all space when replicated. <br> The space lattice of a crystal can be divided into identical parallelepipeds by joining the lattice points with straight lines. (A parallelepiped is a six-sided geometrical solid whose faces are all parallelograms.) Each such parallelepiped is called a <b>unit cell.</b> The way in which a lattice is broken up into unit cells is not unique.</p>




<h2>Cubic Unit Cells</h2>

<p>The cubic crystal system has three possible cubic unit cells: simple (or primitive) cubic, body-centered cubic, and face-centered cubic. These cells are illustrated in Figure 11.33. A <b>simple cubic unit</b> cell is a cubic unit cell in which lattice points are situated only at the corners. A <b>body-centered cubic unit cell</b> is a cubic unit cell in which there is a lattice point at the center of the cubic cell in addition to those at the corners. A <b>face-centered cubic unit cel</b>l is a cubic unit cell in which there are lattice points at the centers of each face of the unit cell in addition to those at the corners. <br>The simplest crystal structures are those in which there is only a single atom at each lattice point. Most metals are examples. Copper metal has a face-centered cubic unit cell with one copper atom at each lattice point (Fig. 2). The unit cells for this and other cubic cells of simple atomic crystals are shown in Figure 11.34. Note that only the portions of the atoms actually within the unit cell are shown. For certain applications, you will need to know the number of atoms in a unit cell of such an atomic crystal. The next example shows how you count atoms in a unit cell.</p>

<p>Copper atoms are packed in a face-centered cubic crystal lattice. Note that each of the eight corner copper atoms is shared by eight neighboring unit cells, and each of the atoms centered at the six faces of the cube is shared by two neighboring unit cells (Fig. 3). Thus, there are (1/8)8 + (1/2)6 = 4 copper atoms per unit cell. Ni has a face centered unit cell too. </p>

<h2>Notation for Points and Planes</h2>

<p>To designate the location of any point in the unit cell, we set up a coordinate system with origin at one corner of the unit cell and axes coinciding with the <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> edges
of the cell. Note that these axes are not necessarily mutually perpendicular. The position of a point in the cell is specified by giving its coordinates as fractions of the unit-cell lengths <i>a, b</i>, and <i>c</i>. Thus, the point at the origin is 000; the interior lattice point in an I lattice is at 1/2 1/2 1/2; the point at the center of the face bounded by the <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> axes is 0 1/2 1/2.<br> The orientation of a crystal plane is described by its <b>Miller indices</b> (<i>hkl</i>), which are obtained by the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>find the intercepts of the plane on the <i>a, b, c</i> axes in terms of multiples of the unit-cell lengths <i>a, b, c</i>;</p></li>
	<li><p>take the reciprocals of these numbers;</p></li>
	<li><p>if fractions are obtained in step 2, multiply the three numbers by the smallest integer that will give whole numbers. If an intercept is negative, one indicates this by a bar over the corresponding Miller index.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>One is usually interested only in planes densely populated by lattice points, since it is these planes which are important in x-ray diffraction (Sec. 23.9). As an example, the shaded plane labeled <i>r</i> in Fig. 23.10 intercepts the a axis at <i>a</i>/2 and the <i>b</i> axis at <i>b</i>/2 and lies parallel to the c axis (intercept at q). Step 1 gives 1/2, 2/1 , ∞. Step 2 gives 2, 2, 0. Hence the Miller indices are (220). The plane labeled <i>s</i> has Miller indices (110). The plane labeled t has intercepts 3/2 <i>a</i>, 3/2 <i>b</i>, q; step 2 gives 2/3, 2/3, 0, and the Miller indices are (220). Plane <i>u</i> has intercepts 2<i>a</i>, 2<i>b</i>, ∞, so step 2 gives 1/2, 1/2, 0, and step 3 gives (110). Also shown are a (111) plane and (100) planes. The higher the value of the Miller index <i>h</i> of a plane, the closer to the origin is the a intercept of the plane. <br> As well as giving the orientation of a single plane, one also uses Miller indices to denote a whole stack of parallel, equally spaced planes. The planes <i>s, u</i>, and an infinite number of planes parallel to them and separated by the same distance as <i>s</i> and <i>u</i> form the set of (110) planes. The set of (220) planes is considered to include the (110) planes plus the planes midway between the (110) planes. Planes <i>r, s, t, u</i>, ... form the (220) set. <br> In determining the Miller indices of a set of parallel equally spaced planes, one looks at the intercepts of the plane closest to the origin but not containing the origin. Each face of a macroscopic crystal contains a high density of lattice points. Examination of the macroscopic shape of a single crystal will generally tell which of the seven crystal systems the crystal belongs to (but will not tell what the Bravais lattice is) and will enable the <i>a, b</i>, and <i>c</i> axes to be located. One can therefore use Miller indices to specify the orientations of the macroscopic faces (surfaces) of the crystal, as well as to specify the orientations of planes within the crystal lattice.</p>

<p>Studies of chemisorption of gases on metals often use a single metal crystal cut to expose a particular face to the gas. One finds that the (100) surface of a metal has different adsorption properties (heats of adsorption, sticking probabilities) than other surfaces such as the (110) surface. The structure of an adsorbed species may differ on different surfaces of the same metal.</p>

<h2>Crystal Defects</h2>

<p>So far we have assumed that crystals have perfect order. In fact, real crystals have various defects or imperfections. These are principally of two kinds: chemical impurities and defects in the formation of the lattice. Ruby is an example of a crystal with a chemical impurity. The crystal is mainly colorless aluminum oxide, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, but occasional aluminum ions, Al<sup>3+</sup> , are replaced by chromium(III) ions, Cr<sup>3+</sup> , which give a red color. <br> Various lattice defects occur during crystallization. Crystal planes may be misaligned, or sites in the crystal lattice may remain vacant. For example, there might be an equal number of sodium ion vacancies and chloride ion vacancies in a sodium chloride crystal. It is also possible to have an unequal number of cation and anion vacancies in an ionic crystal. For example, iron(II) oxide, FeO, usually crystallizes with some iron(II) sites left unoccupied. Enough of the remaining iron atoms have 3+ charges to give an electrically balanced crystal. As a result, there are more oxygen atoms than iron atoms in the crystal. Moreover, the exact composition of the crystal can vary, so the formula FeO is only approximate. Such a compound whose composition varies slightly from its idealized formula is said to be <i>nonstoichiometric</i>. Other examples of nonstoichiometric compounds are Cu<sub>2</sub>O and Cu<sub>2</sub>S. Each usually has less copper than expected from the formula. The recently discovered ceramic materials having superconducting properties at relatively high temperatures (page 876) are nonstoichiometric compounds. An example is yttrium barium copper oxide, YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7−x</sub>, where <i>x</i> is approximately 0.1. It is a compound with oxygen atom vacancies.</p>
