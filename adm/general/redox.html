<h1>Oxidation-Reduction Reactions</h1>

<p>The terms oxidation and reduction come from reactions that have been known for centuries. Ancient civilizations learned how to change metal oxides and sulfi des into the metal, that is, how to “reduce” ore to the metal. A modern example is the reduction of iron(III) oxide with carbon monoxide to give iron metal.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(s) + 3CO (g) ⟶ 2 Fe(s) + 3CO<sub>2</sub>(g)</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li><p>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> loses oxygen and is reduced.</p></li>
	<li><p>CO is the reducing agent. It gains oxygen and is oxidized.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In this reaction carbon monoxide is the agent that brings about the reduction of iron ore to iron metal, so carbon monoxide is called the <b>reducing agent</b>. When Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is reduced by carbon monoxide, oxygen is removed from the iron ore and added to the carbon monoxide. The carbon monoxide, therefore, is “oxidized” by the addition of oxygen to give carbon dioxide. <i>Any process in which oxygen is added to another substance is an oxidation</i>. In the reaction of oxygen with magnesium, for example, oxygen is the <b>oxidizing agent</b> because it is the agent responsible for the oxidation of magnesium.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>2Mg(s) + O<sub>2</sub>(s) ⟶ 2MgO (s)</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li><p>Mg combines with oxygen and is oxidized.</p></li>
	<li><p>O<sub>2</sub> is the oxidizing agent.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Oxidation–Reduction Reactions and Electron Transfer</h2>

<p>The concept of oxidation–reduction reactions has been extended from these and similar examples to a vast number of other reactions, many of which do not even involve oxygen. Rather than concentrate on whether oxygen is gained or lost, let us look at what is going on with electrons during the course of the reaction. All oxidation and reduction reactions can be accounted for by considering them to occur by
means of a transfer of electrons between substances. When a substance accepts electrons, it is said to be reduced because there is a reduction in the numerical value of the charge on an atom of the substance. In the net ionic equation for the reaction of a silver salt with copper metal, positively chargedAg<sup>+</sup> ions accept electrons from copper metal and are reduced to uncharged silver atoms.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>2Ag<sup>+</sup> (aq) + Cu(s) ⟶ 2Ag(s) + Cu<sup>2+</sup> (aq)</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li><p>Ag<sup>+</sup> ions accept electrons from Cu and are reduced to Ag.Ag<sup>+</sup> is the oxidizing agent. Ag<sup>+</sup> (aq) + e<sup>−</sup> ⟶ Ag(s)</p></li>
	<li><p>Cu(s) ⟶ Cu<sup>2+</sup> + 2e<sup>&minus;</sup>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Because copper metal supplies the electrons and causesAg<sup>+</sup> ions to be reduced, Cu is the reducing agent. When a substance loses electrons, the numerical value of the charge on an atom of the substance increases. The substance is said to have been oxidized. In our example, copper metal releases electrons on going to Cu<sup>2+</sup> , so the metal is oxidized. For this to happen, something must be available to accept the electrons from copper. In this case,Ag<sup>+</sup> is the electron acceptor, and its charge is reduced to zero in silver metal. Therefore,Ag<sup>+</sup> is the “agent” that causes Cu metal to be oxidized; that is,Ag<sup>+</sup> is the oxidizing agent.</p>

<p>In every oxidation–reduction reaction, one reactant is reduced (and therefore is the oxidizing agent) and one reactant is oxidized (and therefore is the reducing agent). We can show this by dividing the general redox reaction X + Y → X<sup>n+</sup> + Y<sup>n−</sup> into two parts or half-reactions:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Half Reaction</th> <th>Electron Transfer</th> <th>Result</th></tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr><td>X → X<sup>n+</sup> + <i>n</i>e<sup>−</sup> X</td> <td>transfers electrons to Y</td> <td>X is oxidized to X<sup>n+</sup>. X is the reducing agent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Y + n e<sup>−</sup> ⟶ Y<sup>n−</sup></td> <td>Y accepts electrons from X</td> <td>Y is reduced to Y<sup>n−</sup> . Y is the oxidizing agent.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>In the reaction of magnesium and oxygen, O<sub>2</sub> is reduced because it gains electrons (four electrons per molecule) on going to two oxide ions. Thus, because O<sub>2</sub> is involved in the oxidation of magnesium, it is the oxidizing agent.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>2Mg (s) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) ⟶ 2MgO (s)</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li><p>Mg releases 2e<sup>−</sup> per atom. Mg is oxidized to Mg<sup>2+</sup> and is the reducing agent.</p>
	<li><p>O<sub>2</sub> gains 4 e<sup>−</sup> per molecule to form 2O<sup>2−</sup>. O<sub>2</sub> is reduced and is the oxidizing agent.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Example 3</b> Aluminum metal Al (s) reacts with aqueous iron (II) chloride FeCl<sub>2</sub> (aq) to form aqueous aluminum chloride AlCl<sub>3</sub> (aq) and iron metal Fe.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>2 Al<sup>0</sup> (s) + 3Fe<sup>II</sup>Cl<sub>2</sub> (aq) ⟶ 3Fe<sup>0</sup> (s) + 2Al<sup>III</sup>Cl<sub>3</sub> (aq)</p>
</div>

<p>This is an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>2 Al<sup>0</sup> - 6 e<sup>-</sup> → 2 Al<sup>III</sup> (oxidation)</p>
	<li><p>3 Fe<sup>II</sup> + 6 e<sup>-</sup> → 3 Fe0 (reduction)</p>
</ul>

<p>Al is a reducing agent, FeCl<sub>2</sub> is an oxidizing agent.</p>

<p>In the same reaction, magnesium is the reducing agent because it releases two electrons per atom on being oxidized to the Mg 2+ ion (and so two Mg atoms are required to supply the four electrons required by one O<sub>2</sub> molecule). All redox reactions can be analyzed in a similar manner.<br> The observations outlined so far lead to several important conclusions:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>If one substance is oxidized, another substance in the same reaction must be reduced. For this reason, such reactions are called oxidation–reduction reactions, or <b>redox reactions</b> for short.</p></li>
	<li><p>The reducing agent is itself oxidized, and the oxidizing agent is reduced.</p></li>
	<li><p>Oxidation is the opposite of reduction. For example, the removal of oxygen is reduction and the addition of oxygen is oxidation. The gain of electrons is reduction and the loss of electrons is oxidation.</p></li>
</ul>
