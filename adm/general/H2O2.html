<h1>Hydrogen Perioxide</h1>

<p>Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a very pale blue liquid which appears colourless in a dilute solution, slightly more viscous than water.</p>

<h2>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + KI</h2>
      
<p>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (hydrogen perioxide) will decompose into H<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub> on its own, albeit slowly. Hydrogen peroxide is, however, a long-lived molecule primarly because the peroxide O-O bond energy is quite high 143.5 kJ. One reason H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> comes in dark bottles is to slow this process, which is accelerated by light. To catalyze, or speed up the reaction, we can add KI (Potassium iodide) to the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The KI isn’t changed as a result of the reaction and is not considered a reactant. Instead, we write KI above the “yields” arrow to show that it served as a catalyst in the reaction.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+ I<sup>−</sup> → 	H<sub>2</sub>O 	+ IO<sup>−</sup><br>
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + IO<sup>−</sup> → H<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>2</sub> + I<sup>−</sup><br>
<p>2H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)+ O<sub>2</sub>(g) &emsp; Δ<sub>r</sub><i>H</i>° = −196 kJ·mol<sup>−1</sup></p>
</div>

<p>There is also an enzyme in your blood called catalase. That is why you see bubbles when you put H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on a wound. The bubbles are O<sub>2</sub> gas. Note that enzymes are considered biological catalysts. Hydrogen peroxide has been used as an antiseptic since the 1920s because it kills bacteria cells by destroying their cell walls. It is employed by peroxidases to oxidize a variety of biologically important molecules. This process is called oxidation because the compound's oxygen atoms are incredibly reactive, and they attract, or steal, electrons. With fewer electrons, bacteria cells' walls become damaged or even completely break apart.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, hydrogen peroxide's oxidation also destroys healthy skin cells. This is why many physicians and dermatologists currently advise against using hydrogen peroxide to clean wounds , as it has been found to slow the healing process and possibly worsen scarring by killing the healthy cells surrounding a cut.</p>

<p>Despite its negative effect on healthy cells, our bodies' cells naturally produce hydrogen peroxide when we metabolize food and turn it into energy. So how can a cell produce something that can destroy its own walls? That's where catalase steps in: when a cell creates hydrogen peroxide, it stores it inside the cell's specialized organelles, called peroxisomes, which contain hydrogen peroxide-busting catalase. Inside of a peroxisome, hydrogen peroxide decomposes and is turned into harmless water and oxygen gas.</p>

<p>Catalase is present in the cells of nearly all living organisms, so next time you want to amuse the kids with a fun science trick, pour some hydrogen peroxide on half of a raw potato and watch it fizzle.</p>

<p>Hydrogen peroxide was first reported in 1818 by French Chemist Baron Louis-Jaques Thenard. It is prepared commercially by treating barium peroxide with aqeous acid</p>
