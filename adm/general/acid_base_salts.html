<h1>Acid–Base Properties of Salts</h1>

<p>The term <b>salt</b> is often used by chemists as simply another name for ionic compound. When a salt dissolves in water, we assume that it breaks up into its ions, which move about independently, at least in dilute solutions. Under certain conditions these ions can behave as acids or bases. In this section we explore such reactions.</p>

<h2>Salts That Produce Neutral Solutions</h2>

<p>Recall that the conjugate base of a strong acid has virtually no affinity for protons as compared with that of the water molecule. For this reason strong acids completely dissociate in aqueous solution. Thus, when anions such as Cl<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup> are placed in water, they do not combine with H<sup>+</sup> and therefore have no effect on the pH. Cations such as K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sp>+</sup> from strong bases have no affinity for H<sup>+</sup> and no ability to produce H<sup>+</sup>, so they too have no effect on the pH of an aqueous solution. Salts that consist of the cations of strong bases and the anions of strong acids have no effect on [H<sup>+</sup>] when dissolved in water. This means that aqueous solutions of salts such as KCl, NaCl, NaNO<sub>3</sub>, and KNO<sub>3</sub> are neutral (have a pH of 7).</p>

<h2>Salts That Produce Basic Solutions</h2>

<p>In an aqueous solution of sodium acetate (NaC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), the major species are</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Na<sup>+</sup>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>2−</sup>,     and     H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
</div>

<p>What are the acid–base properties of each component? The Na<sup>+</sup> ion has neither acid nor base properties. The C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>2−</sup> ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, a weak acid. This means that C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>2−</sup> has a significant affinity for a proton and acts as a base. Finally, water is neither a strong enough acid nor a strong enough base to affect [H<sup>+</sup>].</p>

<p>Thus the pH of this solution will be controlled by the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>2−</sup> ion. Since C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>2−</sup> is a base, it will react with the best proton donor available. In this case water is the only source of protons, and the reaction is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>2−</sup> (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) ⇌ HC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (aq) + OH<sup>−</sup> (aq)</p>
</div>

<p>Note that this reaction, which yields a basic solution, involves a base reacting with water to produce the hydroxide ion and a conjugate acid. We have defined K<sub>b</sub> as the equilibrium constant for such a reaction. In this instance</p>

<p>The value of K<sub>a</sub> for acetic acid is well known (1.8 x 10<sup>−5</sup>). But how can we obtain the K<sub>b</sub> value for the acetate ion? The answer lies in the relationships among K<sub>a</sub>, K<sub>b</sub>, and K<sub>w</sub>. Note that when the K<sub>a</sub> expression for acetic acid is multiplied by the K<sub>b</sub> expression for the acetate ion, the result is K<sub>w</sub>:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>K<sub>a</sub> ⋅ K<sub>b</sub> = K<sub>w</sub> <br>
K<sub>b</sub> = 1.0 x 10<sup>−14</sup>/1.8 x 10<sup>−5</sup> = 5.6 x 10<sup>−10</sup></p>
</div>

<p>The sodium acetate solution is an example of an important general case. For any salt whose cation has neutral properties (such as Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup>) and whose anion is the conjugate base of a weak acid, the aqueous solution will be basic.</p>

<h2>Base Strength in Aqueous Solution</h2>

<p>To emphasize the concept of base strength, consider the basic properties of the cyanide ion. One relevant reaction is the dissociation of hydrocyanic acid in water:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>HCN(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) ⇌ H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> (aq) + CN<sup>−</sup> (aq) &emsp; K<sub>a</sub> = 6.2 x 10<sup>−10</sup></p>
</div>

<p>Since HCN is such a weak acid, CN<sup>−</sup> appears to be a strong base, showing a very high affinity for H<sup>+</sup> compared with H<sub>2</sub>O, with which it is competing. However, we also need to look at the reaction in which cyanide ion reacts with 
water:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>CN<sup>−</sup> (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) ⇌ HCN(aq) + OH<sup>−</sup> (aq)</p>
</div>

<p>where</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>K<sub>b</sub> = K<sub>w</sub>/ K<sub>a</sub> = 1.0 x 10<sup>−14</sup>/6.2 x 10<sup>−10</sup> = 1.6 x 10<sup>−5</sup></p>
</div>

<p>In this reaction CN<sup>−</sup> appears to be a weak base; the K<sub>b</sub> value is only 1.6 x 10<sup>−5</sup>. What accounts for this apparent difference in base strength? The key idea is that in the reaction of CN 2 with H 2 O, CN 2 is competing with OH 2 for H 1 ,
instead of competing with H<sub>2</sub>O, as it does in the HCN dissociation reaction. These equilibria show the following relative base strengths:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>OH<sup>−</sup> &gt; CN<sup>−</sup> &gt; H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
</div>

<p>Similar arguments can be made for other “weak” bases, such as ammonia, the acetate ion, and the fluoride ion.</p>

<h2 id="acid">Salts That Produce Acidic Solutions</h2>

<p>Some salts produce acidic solutions when dissolved in water. For example, when solid NH<sub>4</sub>Cl is dissolved in water, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup> ions are released, with NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> behaving as a weak acid:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (aq) ⇌ NH<sub>3</sub> (aq) + H<sup>+</sup> (aq)</p>
</div>

<p>The Cl<sup>−</sup> ion, having virtually no affinity for H<sup>+</sup> in water, does not affect the pH of the solution.
In general, a salt whose cation is the conjugate acid of a weak base produces an acidic solution. <br> A second type of salt that produces an acidic solution is one that contains a highly charged metal ion. For example, when solid aluminum chloride (AlCl<sub>3</sub>) is dissolved in water, the resulting solution is significantly acidic. Although the Al<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> ion is not itself a Brønsted–Lowry acid, the hydrated ion Al(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub><sup>3+</sup> formed in water is a weak acid:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Al(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub><sup>3+</sup> (aq) ⇌ Al(OH)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub><sup>2+</sup> (aq) + H<sup>+</sup> (aq)</p>
</div>

<p>The high charge on the metal ion polarizes the O−H bonds in the attached water molecules, making the hydrogens in these water molecules more acidic than those in free water molecules. Typically, the higher the charge on the metal ion, the stronger is the acidity of the hydrated ion.</p>

<p>So far we have considered salts containing only one ion that has acidic or basic properties. For many salts, such as ammonium acetate (NH<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), both ions affect the pH of the aqueous solution. First, we will consider the qualitative aspects of such problems. We can predict whether the solution will be basic, acidic, or neutral by comparing the K<sub>a</sub> value for the acidic ion with the <i>K<sub>b</sub></i> value for the basic ion. If the K<sub>a</sub> value for the acidic ion is larger than the <i>K<sub>b</sub></i> value for the basic ion, the solution will be acidic. If the K<sub>b</sub> value is larger than the <i>K<sub>a</sub></i> value, the solution is basic. When the <i>K<sub>a</sub></i> and <i>K<sub>b</sub></i> values are equal, the solution is neutral. These facts are summarized in Table 7.5. Table 7.6 summarizes the acid–base properties of aqueous solutions of various salts.</p>
