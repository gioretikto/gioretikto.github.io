<h1>Equivalent weight</h1>

<p>The <b>equivalent weight</b> (mass) of a substance is the mass of that substance that will react with 1 gram of hydrogen. In the case of a substance that doesn't react directly with hydrogen, its equivalent weight corresponds to the quantity in grams that react with an equivalent weight of a another known substance. Thus, the equivalent weight of oxygen is 8 grams that of Chlorine is 35.46 g.</p>

<div class="def">
<p><b>Example 1</b>. 1 g of Calcium combines with 4 g of Bromine. The equivalent weight of bromine is 80 g. Calculate the equivalent weight of Calcium.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>. We have to set the equation 1g Ca/ 4 g Br = x g Ca : 80 g Br. Which yields to the equivalent weight of Calcium of 20 g. &emsp;■</p>

</div>

<p>The name <i>weight</i>, is not correct since we should userather the term <b>equivalent mass</b>, even though the former is more used. Contrary to the atomic weight, which is a pure number, the  equivalent weight is measured in grams.</p>

<p>The equivalent masses of certain substances differ from compound to compound and from reaction to reaction. From example, in hydrogen peroxyde H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the equivalent weight of oxygen is 16 g.</p>

<div class="def">
<p><b>Example 2</b>. Since Cu = 63.5 a.m.u., has two oxidation states (Cu<sup>+</sup>) and Cu<sup>2+</sup> it can form two oxides Cu<sub>2</sub>O and CuO. So, eq. wts are 63.5/1 g and 63.5/2 g erspectevely.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>63.5 ⋅ 2 g Cu /16 g O = x g Cu / 8 g. O</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Form last examples it becomes evident that elements having more than one valency values, have different equivalent weights and can be found by the relation</p> 

<div class="eq">
<p>Equivalent weight of an element = Atomic weight of the elment/valency of the element </p>
</div>

<p>So since Cu has two valency corresponding to 1 for Cuprous (Cu<sup>+</sup>) and 2 for cupric Cu<sup>2+</sup> we can calculate the eq. wts as 63.5/1 g and 63.5/2 g erspectevely.</p>

<p>The concept of equivalent weight arose from the studies conducted by the Prussian chemist Jeremias Benjamin Richter (1762-1807), lo stesso che coniò il termine stoichiometry, da στοιχεῖον, "stoicheion" "elemento" e μέτρον, "metron" "measure", published a book entitled "Anfangsgriinde der Stochiometric oder MeBkunst chemischer Elemente", that is <i>Principles of Stoichiometry or Art of Measuring Chemical Elements</i>. Nel 1792, formulò la <b>legge delle proporzioni reciproche</b>:</p>

<blockquote>Weights of two elements A and B which combines separately with a fixed weight of third element C, are either the same or the simple multiples of weights of A and B which combine with each other.</blockquote>

<p>As an example, 1 g of Hydrogen (A) combines with 35.45 g of Cl (B) or with 8 g of Oxygen (C). The ration between the two masses is m(B):m(C) è 35.45:8. The same ratio is observed when Cl and O react to form ClO<sub>2</sub>: 70.9 g of Cl react with 16 g of O, with the ratio m(C):m(B) = 70.9:16 = 35.45:8. </p>

<table>

<tr><th>Compounds</th> <th colspan="2">Reacting masses</th> <th>Ratio between masses</th></tr>

<tr><td>H<sub>2</sub>O</td> <td>1 g</td> <td>8 g</td> <td>1:8</td></tr>

<tr><td>Cl<sub>2</sub>O</td> <td>70.9</td> <td>16 g</td> <td>70.9:16 = 35.45:8</td></tr>

<tr><td>HCl</td> <td>1 g</td> <td>35.45 g</td> <td>35.45:1</td></tr>

<tr><td>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></td> <td>2 g</td> <td>32 g</td> <td>1:16</td></tr>

</table>

<p>An other example is the following:</p>

<table>

<tr><th>Compounds</th> <th colspan="2">Reacting masses</th> <th>Ratio between masses</th></tr>

<tr><td>CS<sub>2</sub></td> <td>12 g</td> <td>64 g</td> <td>64:12</td></tr>

<tr><td>CO<sub>2</sub></td> <td>12 g</td> <td>32 g</td> <td>32:12</td></tr>

<tr><td>SO<sub>2</sub></td> <td>32 g</td> <td>32 g</td> <td>32:32</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The ratio between the masses of S and O, involved in the formation of CS<sub>2</sub></td> and CO<sub>2</sub></td> is 32:32 a submultiples dof the ratio 64:32 = 2.</p>

<p>Un elemento può avere più di un peso equivalente, poichè può formare più di un composto. Ad esempio l'idrogeno oltre all'acqua forma l'acqua ossigenata H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, in questo caso il peso equivalente dell'ossigeno è 16 e non 8 come nell'acqua; L'azoto ha peso equivalente 14 g in N<sub>2</sub>O, 7g in NO e 4.67g in N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></p>

<p>The equivalent weight of a compount is obtained from the sum dei pesi equivalenti degli elementi di cui esso è costituito:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>pE(CO<sub>2</sub>) = pE(C) + pE(O) = 12g + 8g = 20g</p>
</div>

<p><b>Example 1</b>. A sample of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contains 42.95 grams of Al and 38.4 grams of oxygen. Knowing that the equivalent weight of oxygen is 8.0 g, calculate the equivalent weight of Aluminum.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>. The ratio between the combination weights of the two elements is proportional to the equivalent weights of the two elements. That is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>42.95 g : 38.4 g = x : 8.0 g</p>
</div>

<p>with <i>x</i> the equivalent weight of aluminum. Solving the equation we find <i>x</i> = 9 g.&emsp;■</p>
