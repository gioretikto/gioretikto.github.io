<h1>Determination of the Rate Law</h1>

<p>As noted earler, a rate law must be determined experimentally. To see the logic needed to determine a rate law, let's think about a simple reaction in which some substance A is the only reactant. The rate for such a reaction is the following</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>d[A]/d<i>t</i> = <i>k</i> [A]<sup><i>n</i></sup></p>
</div>

<p>The order of a reaction <i>n</i>, is usually an integer and is rarely greater than two. That gives us three likely orders: 0, 1, and 2. In each of these cases, if the concentration of A is doubled, the rate will change in a simple and predictable way.</p>

<ol type="a">
	<li><p>If <i>n</i> = 0, doubling the concentration of <i>A</i> does not change the rate at all since [2A]<sup>0</sup> = 1.</p></li>
	<li><p>If <i>n</i> = 1, doubling the concentration of <i>A</i> <i>doubles</i> the rate.</p></li>
	<li><p>If <i>n</i> = 2, doubling the concentration of <i>A</i> increases the rate by a <i>factor of</i> [2A]<sup>2</sup> = 4.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Other orders of reaction are possible and can give more complicated relationships. As a more general example, consider the reaction of substances A and B to give D and E, according to the balanced equation</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>aA + bB  ⟶ dD + eE</p>
</div>

<p>Using the reactants in the chemical equation, you assume the rate law has the following form:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Rate = <i>k</i>[A]<sup>m</sup> [B]<sup>n</sup></p>
</div>

<p>You can determine each of the reaction orders (exponents <i>m, n</i>) by choosing experiments in which all concentrations of reactants except one are held constant.</p>

<div class="def">

<p><b>Example</b>. (<i>Determining the Rate Law from Initial Rates</i>) Iodide ion is oxidized in acidic solution to triiodide ion, I<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, by hydrogen peroxide.</p>

<div class="eq">

</div>

<p>A series of four experiments was run at different concentrations, and the initial rates of I<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> formation were determined (see table).</p>

<p><b>Strategy</b>. a. In order to know the reaction orders of the reactants, you need to know the rate law. Using the reactants in the chemical equation, you assume the rate law has the following form:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Rate = <i>k</i> [H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]<sup><i>m</i></sup>[I<sup>−</sup>]<sup><i>n</i></sup>[H<sup>+</sup>]<sup>p</sup></p>
</div>

<p>You can determine each of the reaction orders (exponents <i>m, n</i>, and <i>p</i>) by choosing experiments in which all concentrations of reactants except one are held constant. Solving for each exponent will require comparing different experiments. Once you know the reaction orders, you will know the rate law. b. To determine the rate constant, you can take the data from one of the experiments and substitute them into the rate law; the only unknown in the equation will be the rate constant, <i>k</i>.</p>

<p>Comparing Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, you see that when the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration is doubled (with other concentrations constant), the rate is doubled. From the Table, you see that <i>m</i> = 1. The reaction is first order in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. </p>

<p>Comparing Experiment 1 and Experiment 3, you see that doubling the I<sup>−</sup> concentration (with the other concentrations constant) doubles the rate. Therefore, <i>n</i> = 1 (the reaction is first order in I<sup>−</sup>).</p>

<p>Finally, comparing Experiment 1 and Experiment 4, you see that doubling the H<sup>+</sup> concentration (holding other concentrations constant) has no effect on the rate. Therefore, <i>p</i> = 0 (the reaction is zero order in H<sup>+</sup>). Because [H<sup>+</sup>]<sup>0</sup> = 1, the rate law is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Rate = <i>k</i> [H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>][I<sup>−</sup>]</p>
