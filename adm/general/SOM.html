<p><p>Soil Organic Matter (SOM) represents the remains of roots, plant material, and soil organisms in various stages of decomposition and synthesis, and is variable in composition. Though occuring in relatevely small amounts in soils, organic matter (OM) has a major influence on soil aggregation, nutrient reserve and its availability, , moistured retention, and biological activity. Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) ranges from being the dominant constituent of peat or muck soils in colder regions of the world to being virtually absent in some desert soils. Cultivated, temperate-region soild normally have often 3-4% SOM; while soils of semi-arid rainfed areas, have normally less than 1.5% SOM. <br> Most laboratories perform analysis for SOM, which can be measured by either the loss after ignition method, i.e., weight change destruction of organic compounds by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatement or by ignition at high temperature, or by wet combustion analysis of soils by chromic acid digestion, which is the standard method for determining total C. Also, organic matter/organic carbon can be estimated by volumetric and colorimetric methods. However, the most common procedure involves reduction of potassium dichromate (K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) by OC compounds and subsequent determination of the unreduced dichromate by OC compounds and subsequent determination of the unreduced dichromate by oxidation-reduction titration with ferrous ammonium sulfate. This method is referred to as the <b>Walkley-Black method</b>.</p>

<p><b>Nitrogen mineralization</b> is the conversion of organic nitrogen to inorganic forms of nitrogen (Nmin). It is part of the microbial degradation of nitrogen-rich organic matter (Robertson and Groffman, 2007). Organic nitrogen comprises about 90% of total nitrogen in most soils (Kelley and Stevenson, 1995) and includes biomass (proteins, etc.), detritus, and humics. The most important enzyme classes involved in nitrogen mineralization are deaminases, O-glycosidases, and acetyl hydrolases (Mengel, 1996). The reverse process of mineralization is <b>immobilization</b>. During nitrogen <i>immobilization</i>, microorganisms assimilate inorganic nitrogen for the synthesis of proteins and other nitrogen-containing organic compounds (Janssen, 1996; Mengel, 1996). This process occurs frequently when nitrogen-poor organic matter is decomposed (Janssen, 1996; Robertson and Groffman, 2007). Both processes, nitrogen mineralization and immobilization, occur simultaneously in soil. Therefore it is of great importance to distinguish between gross and net mineralization and immobilization. When gross mineralization exceeds immobilization the Nmin content of the soil increases. Net immobilization occurs when gross immobilization rates are higher than mineralization rates, resulting in a decreased Nmin content (Robertson and Groffman, 2007). The balance between nitrogen mineralization and immobilization is mainly controlled by the C:N ratio of the organic material being decomposed (Stevenson and Cole, 1999; Robertson and Groffman, 2007). As long as C and N are available from compounds with similar degradation rates, a C:N ratio of below 20 usually leads to net mineralization. Net immobilization occurs mainly when the C:N ratio of the decomposed organic matter exceeds 30 (Stevenson and Cole, 1999).</p>

<h2>C:N ratio</h2>

<p>Generally, the C/N ratio required for bacteria is 5 and for fungi is 10. Fungi tend to have a larger C/N ratio than bacteria because bacteria contain a larger proportion of structural peptides than bacteria. So a typical average C/N ratio for soil microbial biomass is 8. When C is available in excess of N, fungal populations can become more prevalent, because they have larger C/N ratio and proportionally smaller requirements for N. It would then seem logical that at the C/N ratio of 8, there would be a net balance between mineralization and immobilization. However, one must take into account that only approximately 40% of the carbon in organic matter is actually incorporated into cell mass (the rest is lost as carbo dioxide during respiration). Thus, the C/N raio must be increased by a factor of 2.5 to account for the C lost as CO<sub>2</sub> during respiration. Note that N is cycled more efficiently than C, and there are essentially no losses in its uptake. In fact, a C/N raio of 20 is not only the theoretical balance point but also the pratically observed one. Above C/N of 20 nitrogen is immobilized, because the substrate offern a nitrogen deficit to the decomposers, which becomes temporarily unavailable to roots. In contrast, below 20 is mineralized, because there is a surplus of nitrogen relative to carbon in the substrate. </p>
