<h1>Chocolate</h1>

<p>Chocolate is made up of a lot of different components. The main ingredients are cocoa butter which stores the heat when chocolate is warmed and cocoa powder which gives the chocolate its magnificent taste. </p>

<p>Cocoa butter as is known is made of little crystals. In total we differ between 6 different crystals of which there are different forms of stability. The more stable crystals give the chocolate a better taste and therefore much higher quality.</p>

<table>
<caption>Table of various crystals in cocoa butter. Unstable crystals melt at a lower temperature than stable crystals which 
normally melt at body temperature and give the “melt-on-the-tongue taste”.</caption>

<p>Storing chocolate at low temperatures (such as those in convenience store refrigerators) results in a phase change of the chocolate from the desired beta phase to a less dense mix of alpha and beta phases (or even just alpha phase).</p>
