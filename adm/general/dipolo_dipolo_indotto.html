<h1>Interazioni dipolo-dipolo indotto</h1>
      
<p>Polar molecules such as water can induce, or create, a dipole in molecules that do not have a permanent dipole. The solubilities of common gases in water illustrate the effect of interactions between a dipole and an induced dipole. Dissolved gases (oxygen for fish and carbon dioxide for photosynthetic algae) are crucial to the welfare of living species in water. As the molar mass of the gas increases, the polarizability of the electron cloud increases and the strength of the dipole-induced dipole interaction increases. To see how this can happen, picture a polar water molecule approaching a nonpolar molecule such as O<sub>2</sub>. The electron cloud of an isolated (gaseous) O<sub>2</sub> molecule is symmetrically distributed between the two oxygen atoms. As the negative end of the polar H<sub>2</sub>O molecule approaches, however, the O<sub>2</sub> electron cloud becomes distorted. In this process, the O<sub>2</sub> molecule itself becomes polar; that is, a dipole is induced in the otherwise nonpolar O<sub>2</sub> molecule. The result is that H<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub> molecules are now attracted to one another, albeit only weakly. Oxygen can dissolve in water because a force of attraction exists between waterâ€™s permanent dipole and the induced dipole in O<sub>2</sub>. Chemists refer to such interactions as <b>dipole-induced dipole interactions</b>.</p>

<p>The process of inducing a dipole is called polarization, and the degree to which the electron cloud of an atom or a molecule can be distorted depends on the polarizability of that atom or molecule. The electron cloud of an atom or molecule with a large, extended electron cloud such as I<sub>2</sub> can be polarized more readily than the electron cloud in a much smaller atom or molecule, such as He or H<sub>2</sub>, in which the valence electrons are close to the nucleus and more tightly held. In general, for an analogous series of substances, say the halogens or alkanes (such as CH<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, and so on), the higher the molar mass, the greater the polarizability of the molecule.</p>
