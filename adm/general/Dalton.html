<h1>Law of multiple proportions</h1>

<p>Proust’s law of definite proportion stimulated the English schoolteacher John Dalton (1766–1844), to think about atoms. Dalton reasoned that if elements were composed of tiny individual particles, a given compound should always contain the same combination of these atoms. This concept explained why the same relative masses of elements were always found in a given compound. <br> Dalton knew that under different conditions, some elements combine with others in more than one way. For example, carbon and oxygen can combine to form two different gases, containing different relative amounts of carbon and oxygen, as shown by the following data:</p>

<table class="noborder">
<tr><th></th> <th>Mass of Oxygen That Combines<br>with 1 g of Carbon</th></tr>
<tr><td>Compound I</td> <td>1.33 g</td></tr>
<tr><td>Compound II</td> <td>2.66 g</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Note that the ratio of the amounts of oxygen in the two compounds is 2 to 1 (2.6642 / 1.3321), which indicates that there must be twice as much oxygen in the second compound, hence we can deduce that Compound I might be CO and Compound II might be CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Dalton realized that when element combine with each other in serval different ways, the law of definite proportions still holds true. It is just that several different proportions are sometimes possible. Dalton called this the <b>law of multiple proportions</b>:</p>

<blockquote>When two elements form more than one compound, the masses of one element in these compounds for a fixed mass of the other element are in ratios of small whole numbers.</blockquote>

<p>As another example we consider nitrogen, which forms different compounds with oxygen, as illustrated by the following table</p>

<table class="noborder">
<tr><th></th> <th>Mass of Nitrogen That Combines<br>with 1 g of Oxygen</th></tr>
<tr><td>Compound I</td> <td>1.750 g</td></tr>
<tr><td>Compound II</td> <td>0.8750 g</td></tr>
<tr><td>Compound III</td> <td>0.4375 g</td></tr>
</table>

<p>which yield the following ratios:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Compound I/ Compound II = 1.750/0.8750 = 2/1<br>
Compound II/ Compound III = 0.8750 / 0.4375 = 2/1<br>
Compound I/ CompoundIII = 1.750 / 0.4375 = 4/1</p>
</div>

<p>From which we can deduce that compound I contains twice as much nitrogen (N) per gram of oxygen (O) as does compound II and that compound II contains twice as much nitrogen per gram of oxygen as does compound III. II contains twice as much nitrogen per gram of oxygen as does compound III. In terms of the numbers of atoms combining, these data can be explained by any of the following sets of formulas:</p>

<table class="noborder">
<tr><td>Compound I</td> <td>N<sub>2</sub>O</td> <td></td> <td>NO</td> <td></td> <td>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub></td></tr>
<tr><td>Compound II</td> <td>NO</td> <td>or</td> <td>NO<sub>2</sub></td> <td>or</td> <td>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></td> </tr>
<tr><td>Compound III</td> <td>NO<sub>2</sub></td> <td></td> <td>NO<sub>4</sub></td> <td></td> <td>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Since an infinite number of other possibilities exists, Dalton could not deduce absolute formulas from the available data on relative masses. However, the data on the composition of compounds in terms of the relative masses of the elements supported his hypothesis that each element consisted of a certain type of atom and that compounds were formed from specific combinations of atoms.</p>

<p><b>Example 1</b>. Copper forms to oxides with oxygen in which oxygen has the following weight percentage: 80% and 66.5%. Verify that these two compounds follow the law of multiple proportions.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>. We must prove that the quantities of oxygen reacting with a fixed amount of copper (for example 1 g) in the formation of the two compounds have a ratio that can be expressed in terms of integer factors. We indicate the two compounds as Cu<sub>a</sub>O<sub>b</sub> and Cu<sub>c</sub>O<sub>d</sub>. We write the followin proportions</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Compound I &emsp; 80.0g: 20.0g = 1.0 g : x<br>
Compound II &emsp; 66.5g: 33.5 g = 1.0 g : y</p>
</div>

<p>Solving for <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> we obtain the quantities of oxygen reaction with 1 g of copper in the two compounds</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>x</i> = 0.25 g &emsp; <i>y</i> = 0.50 g</p>
</div>

<p>The ratio 0.50/0.25 = 1/2 thus we conclude the compound II has twice the amount of oxygen per gram of copper than compound I. The formulas for the two compounds might be CuO and CuO<sub>2</sub>. &emsp;■</p>

<h2 id="atomic">Dalton’s Atomic Theory</h2>

<p>In 1808, Dalton publishes <i>A new System of Chemical Philosophy</i>, in which he presented the first modern atomic theory. Although it was Proust who first stated the law of definite proportions, it was the English chemist John Dalton who discovered what the law really meant. Elements always combine in definite proportions because each element is made up of indivisible particles, with a definite size and mass, which Dalton called atoms. Atoms are the smallest possible particles of each element.</p>

<p>Dalton's atomic theory was bades on the following postulates</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Each element is made up of tiny indivisible particles called <b>atoms</b>.</p></li>
	<li><p>The atoms of a given element are identical; the atoms of different elements are different in some fundamental way or ways.</p></li>
	<li><p>Chemical compounds are formed when atoms combine with one another. A given compound always has the same relative numbers and types of atoms.</p></li>
	<li><p>Chemical reactions involve reorganization of the atoms—changes in the way they are bound together. The atoms themselves are not changed in a chemical reaction.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In order to represent chemical reactions as combinations of atoms, Dalton affirmed a “principle of greatest simplicity. This assumption led him to assign the formula AB to the single compound
formed by A and B, the formulas CD and either C<sub>2</sub>D or CD<sub>2</sub> to the two compounds formed by C and D, and so on. Application of this principle led to assigning the formula HO to water (believed at the time to be the only compound of hydrogen and oxygen). <br> In Dalton’s time, water was known to be composed of the elements hydrogen and oxygen, with 8 grams of oxygen present for every 1 gram of hydrogen. If the formula for water were OH, an oxygen atom would have to have eight times the mass of a hydrogen atom. However, the same ratio by mass can be obtained considering the possibility for water to be H<sub>2</sub>O, (two atoms of hydrogen for every oxygen atom), this would mean that each atom of oxygen is 16 times as heavy as each atom of hydrogen.<br> Following his simplicity principle, given the known 1: 8 weight ratio in water, the formula for water should be OH, with the consequant assignment of an atomic weight of 8 to oxygen, relative to hydrogen at 1. This assignment was puzzling. Clearly water (HO) must be heavier than oxygen (O), but it was known that the density of water vapor is less than the density of oxygen. </p>

<p>As another example a fixed massa of carbon, e.g. 100 g., possono reagire con 133 g di ossigeno per produrre un ossido e con 266 grammi di ossigeno per produrne un altro. Il rapporto tra la massa di ossigeno che reagisce con 100 grammi di carbonio è 266:133 = 2:1, un rapporto tra piccoli numeri interi. Dalton interpretò questo risultato con la sua teoria atomica proponendo correttamente (questa volta) che i due ossidi hanno uno e due atomi di ossigeno per ogni atomo di carbonio. Esprimendo in formule chimiche si ha: CO (monossido di carbonio) e CO<sub>2</sub> (anidride carbonica).</p>

<p>Sebbene Dalton avesse chiarito molti aspetti della reattività chimica, rimanevano ancora delle ambiguità. Dalton credeva che le molecole da lui chiamate "atomi composti", potessero formarsi esclusivamente tra atomi di <i>elementi diversi</i> escludendo la possibilità come oggi sappiamo che elementi uguali possano unirsi a formare molecole.</p> 

<p>L'esempio precedente in cui Dalton riesce a ricavare le formule chimiche degli ossidi del carbonio è un caso fortuito. Dalton considerava infatti la formula dell'acqua come HO dal fatto che il rapporto tra le masse di idrogeno e ossigeno è 1/8. Ponendo il peso atomico dell'idrogeno uguale ad 1, concludeva erroneamente che quello dell'ossigeno fosse 8.</p> 

<p>Tramite la legge delle proporzioni multiple non si possono dedurre i pesi atomici. Si possono ottenere solo rapporti ponderali e in base ad essi si possono ricavare pesi che possono essere multipli o sottomultipli dei pesi atomici. </p>

<p>A further difficulty for Dalton was the volume relation in the reaction that produces carbon monoxide</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>C + oxygen (1 volume) = CO (2 volumes).</p>
</div>

<p>It seemed to Dalton that equal volumes of gases may contain unequal numbers of particles. In the above reaction, there must be twice as many oxygen particles as carbon monoxide particles in a given volume
of gas.</p>
