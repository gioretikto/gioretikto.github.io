<h1>Fractional Distillation of Liquefied Air</h1>

<p>Except for <a href="He.html">helium</a>, which is mostly extracted from natural gas, oxygen, nitrogen and the other rare gases are extracted from the air that makes up Earth's atmosphere, through a process known as <b>fractional distillation of liquefied air</b>, a process first described in 1907 by von Linde. Air is filtered to remove dust and other solids, water vapour and carbon dioxide. Water vapour and carbon dioxide are removed because they solidify at low temperatures and this would block the flow of liquid air through the pumps and pipes. As the dry air free of carbon dioxide is compressed to 200 times atmospheric pressure it becomes warm. Heat is removed by a network of pipes carrying liquid nitrogen. The cold, compressed air is then allowed to expand rapidly thus cooling even further to the point where most of the air is liquefied.<br>
The gas mixture is then purified by fractional distillation. Dense <a href="O.html">oxygen</a> is captured as liquid as it sinks while <a href="N.html">nitrogen</a> gas escapes from the top and is collected.</p>

<h2>Production of O<sub>2</sub> through molecular filtration</h2>

<p>It is sometimes more convenient for some industrial plants to produce their own oxygen and nitrogen on site, provided a purity of 90% or so is acceptable.  Pressure swing adsorption can provide this and produce up to about 100 tonnes a day. To produce oxygen, a stream of clean air is passed through a bed of alumina to dry the gas and then through a bed of zeolite molecular sieve. Nitrogen is preferentially retained (adsorbed) leaving an oxygen-enriched gaseous stream to pass through (Figure 7).  When the zeolite becomes saturated with nitrogen it is necessary to regenerate it.  This can be achieved simply by reducing the pressure, whereupon the nitrogen is released (desorbed) back into the gaseous phase and rejected as waste.  The sieve is totally regenerated in this way and is ready to repeat the cycle.

<p>Two beds are usually used in rotation.  One is used to produce the oxygen while the other is being regenerated.  The full cycle time can vary between 2 and 8 minutes depending upon actual performance requirements. Instead of using a zeolite as in the manufacture of oxygen, nitrogen is produced from air using beds of carbon molecular sieve (CMS).  Clean, dry, compressed air is passed through a bed of CMS (typically at 7-I2 atm). Oxygen is adsorbed on the surface of the CMS and nitrogen passes through to storage.  When oxygen saturation is reached a second bed is brought on-stream, retaining continuity of supply and the first vented to atmosphere to desorb the oxygen and hence regenerating the CMS prior to the next cycle.  Similar to the production of oxygen by PSA, the full cycle time for nitrogen varies between 2 and 8 minutes.</p>
