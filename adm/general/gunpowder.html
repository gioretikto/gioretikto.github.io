<h1>Gunpowder</h1>

<p>The black gunpowder ingridients have remained about the same since its Chinese invention. It is a mixture of saltpete (potassium nitrate, KNO<sub>3</sub>), sulfur S and charcoal C. A fuse ignites this, and when the temperature becomes high enough chemical reactions start. The main reaction can be represented by</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>4KNO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> + 5C ⟶ 2N<sub>2</sub> + 5CO<sub>2</sub> + 2K<sub>2</sub>O</p>
</div>

<p>and as well the oxidation of sulfur to sulfur dioxide SO<sub>2</sub> and sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>) takes place</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>4KNO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> + 5S ⟶ 2N<sub>2</sub> + 5SO<sub>2</sub> + 2K<sub>2</sub>O</p>
</div>

<p>The chemical reaction involved produces a lot of energy and gases. Any chemical reactoin would become faster at higher temperatures. Therefore, as a heat-producing reaction proceeds, the temperature goes up and hence the reaction becomes even faster. The other factor is the production of gas that creates the force of the explosion. The sudden expansion of gas creates a detonating sound (boom sound).</p>

<h2>Oxidation Reaction involved</h2>

<p>The oxidation number of nitrogen in nitrate  NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>is +5 [i.e. 3 ⋅ (−2) (from the O<sup>2−</sup>) + (+5) = −1 = overll charge]. Since the nitrogen carries a +5 electric charge in nitrate, it's like 5 electron have been removed. This requires a lot of energy, because an electron is attracted by the positive nucleus, and you've to pull them aparat with force. As a consequence ti is a rather unstable state that wanto to become more stable, by gaining electron to bcome lowe oxidation states, fro example, the zero oxidation state, which is N<sub>2</sub> molecule. This can happen when the nitrate comes into contact which can provide electron as Charcoal and sulfur. Charcoal is essentially carbon C which can readily give up electron to become nominally +4, in CO<sub>2</sub>. In this process, nitrate has gotten elecgtron from C ands turns into N<sub>2</sub>. Similar reaction occur between nitrate and sulfur; sulfur will become sulfur dioxide SO<sub>2</sub> and sulfatre SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>. </p>
