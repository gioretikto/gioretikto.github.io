<h1>De Broglie's Hypothesis</h1>

<p>Bohr's theory regarding quantisation of energy in hydrogen atom was considered to be quite arbitraty, as he gave no reasons as to why onbly a discrete set of energy values were allowed for the electron in the atom. <br> Quantisation, however, is inherent in wave motion. For example, a string fixes at the two ends can vibrate at frequencies <i>&nu;</i>, 2<i>&nu;</i>, 3<i>&nu;</i>, etc, i.e., its frequencies are quantised, and a vibration is synonymous with wave motion. <br> These condiderations led a young French physicist, Louis de Broglie, in 1924 to propose that i was possible to explain quantisation of energy in an atom if one considered that some sort of wave motion was associated with electronic motion, that is, if electrons too, like electromagnetic light, exhibited the dual behaviour of particle and waves. In other words, electron in an atom could be suposed to behave very much like a vibrating string with fixes ends.</p>

<p>In molti esperimenti la luce esibisce un carattere prettamente ondulatoriio. Nel 1800 lo scienziato britannico Thomas Young dimostrò la diffrazione della luce. Fenomeno tipico delle onde causato dall'interferenza. Ma in molti altri casi come l'<a href="fotoelettrico.html">effetto fotoelettrico</a> la luce assume un carattere corpuscolare.</p> 

<p>A causa di questa sua duplice essenza si parla di <i>dualismo onda-particella</i> della luce. Nel 1924 il fisico francese Louis De Broglie, ipotizzò che data che la luce possiede questo duplice carattere onda-particella, in modo simmetrico anche la materia avrebbe potuto manifestare un carattere ondulatorio in certe condizioni.</p> 

<p>Nella sua teoria della relatività Einstein ha mostrato che la lunghezza d'onda, &lambda; e il momento di un fotone <i>p</i> sono relazionati tramite l'equazione:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&lambda;</i> = <i>h</i> / <i>p</i></p>
</div>

<p>De Broglie proposed that the wavelength of a material particle is likewise given by. Given the momentum of a particle <i>mv</i>, we have</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&lambda;</i> = <i>h</i>/(<i>mv</i>) &emsp;or &emsp; <i>h</i>/<i>p</i></p>
</div>

<p>For example, an electron (<i>m</i> = 9.1 x 10<sup>−31</sup> kg) having a velocity of 10<sup>6</sup> ms<sup>−1</sup> would have a wavelength,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&lambda;</i> = 6.62 x 10<sup>−34</sup> Js/(9.1 x 10<sup>−31</sup> kg x 10<sup>6</sup> ms<sup>−1</sup>) = 7 x 10<sup>−10</sup> m = 70 nm</p>
</div>

<p>The order of magnitude of the wavelength shows that the wave effects can be felt in electrons; for large particles, however, the wavelength will be too small to lead to observable wave effects. For example, a particle of mass 1 g moving with a velocity 10 cm <sup>−1</sup> will have the wavelength</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&lambda;</i> = 6.62 x 10<sup>−34</sup> J⋅s/(1 x 10<sup>−3</sup> kg x 10<sup>−2</sup> ms<sup>−1</sup>) = 6.62 x 10<sup>−30</sup> m</p>
</div>

<p>De Broglie's hypothesis was verified experimentally by Davisson and Germer, working independently, three years later through electron diffraction experiments. If eletrons were waves then they would produce diffraction patterns when passed through a thin diffraction grating. This was exactly what they observed when electron were passed through a crystal of nickel. Diffraction effects are also observed with neutrons, protons, helium atoms, etc., establishing that the de Broglie hypothesis of wave-particle duality is applicable to all subatomic particles as also to very small atoms.</p>
