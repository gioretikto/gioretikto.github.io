<h1>Detection and Uses of Radioactivity</h1>

<p>Although various instruments measure radioactivity levels, the most familiar of them is the <b>Geiger–Müller counter</b>, or <b>Geiger counter</b>. This instrument takes advantage of the fact that the high-energy particles from radioactive decay processes produce ions when they travel through matter. The probe of the Geiger counter is filled with argon gas, which can be ionized by a rapidly moving particle. This reaction is demonstrated by the equation:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Ar(g) ⟶ Ar<sup>+</sup> (g) + e<sup>−</sup></p>
</div>

<p>Normally, a sample of argon gas will not conduct a current when an electrical potential is applied. However, the formation of ions and electrons produced by the passage of the high-energy particle allows a momentary current to flow. Electronic devices detect this current flow, and the number of these events can be counted. Thus the decay rate of the radioactive sample can be determined.<br> Another instrument often used to detect levels of radioactivity is a <b>scintillation counter</b>, which takes advantage of the fact that certain substances, such as zinc sulfide, give off light when they are struck by high-energy radiation. A photocell senses the flashes of light that occur as the radiation strikes and thus measures the number of decay events per unit of time.</p>

<h2>Dating by Radioactivity</h2>

<p>Archaeologists, geologists, and others involved in reconstructing the ancient history of the earth rely heavily on radioactivity to provide accurate dates for artifacts and rocks. A method that has been very important for dating ancient articles made from wood or cloth is ­ radiocarbon dating, or carbon-14 dating, a technique originated in the 1940s by Willard Libby, an American chemist who received a Nobel Prize for his efforts in this field.<br> Radiocarbon dating is based on the radioactivity of the nuclide 14-C, which decays via b-particle production:</p>

<p>Carbon-14 is continuously produced in the atmosphere when high-energy neutrons from space collide with nitrogen-14:</p>

<p>Thus carbon-14 is continuously produced by this process, and it continuously decomposes through b-particle production. Over the years, the rates for these two processes have become equal, and like a participant in a chemical reaction at equilibrium, the amount of C-14 that is present in the atmosphere remains approximately constant.</p>

<p>Carbon-14 can be used to date wood and cloth artifacts because the C-14, along with the other carbon isotopes in the atmosphere, reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. A living plant consumes carbon dioxide in the photosynthesis process and incorporates the carbon, including 146 C, into its molecules. As long as the plant lives, the C-14/C-12 ratio in its molecules remains the same as in the atmosphere because of the continuous uptake of carbon. However, as soon as a tree is cut to make a wooden bowl or a flax plant is harvested to make linen, the C-14/C-12 ratio begins to decrease because of the radioactive decay of C-14 (the C-12 nuclide is stable). Since the half-life of 146 C is 5730 years, a wooden bowl found in an archaeological dig showing a C-14/C-12 ratio that is half that found in currently living trees is approximately 5730 years old. This reasoning assumes that the current C-14/C-12 ratio is the same as that found in ancient times. <br> Dendrochronologists, scientists who date trees from annual growth rings, have used data collected from long-lived species of trees, such as bristlecone pines and sequoias, to show that the C-14 content of the atmosphere has changed significantly over the ages. These data have been used to derive correction factors that allow very accurate dates to be determined from the observed C-14/C-12 ratio in an artifact, especially for artifacts 10,000 years old or younger. Recent measurements of uranium-to-thorium ratios in ancient coral indicate that dates in the 20,000- to 30,000-year range may have errors as large as 3000 years. As a result, efforts are now being made to recalibrate the C-14 dates over this period.</p>

<p>One drawback of radiocarbon dating is that a fairly large piece of the object (from a half to several grams) must be burned to form carbon dioxide, which is then analyzed for radioactivity. Another method for counting 146 C nuclides avoids destruction of a significant portion of a valuable artifact. This technique, requiring only about 10<sup>−3</sup> g, uses a mass spectrometer (see Chapter 5), in which the carbon atoms are ionized and accelerated through a magnetic field that deflects their path. Because of their different masses, the various ions are deflected by different amounts and can be counted separately. This allows a very accurate determination of the 146 Cy 126 C ratio in the sample. In their attempts to establish the geologic history of the earth, geologists have made 206
extensive use of radioactivity. For example, since U-238 decays to the stable Pb-82 nuclide, the ratio of Pb-82 to U-92 in a rock can, under favorable circumstances, be used to ­estimate the age of the rock. The radioactive nuclide Lu-176, which decays to Hf-72, has a half-life of 37 billion years (only 186 nuclides out of 10 trillion decay each year!). Thus this nuclide can be used to date very old rocks. With this technique, scientists have estimated that the earth’s crust formed 4.3 billion years ago.</p>
