<h1>Radioactivity</h1>

<p>La prima osservazione della radioattività fu un evento di serendipità fatto da Hendri Bacquerel (1852 - 1908) in 1896 found that fluorescent uranium sulphate did give out rays, which could affect a photographic plate even when wrapped in thick black paper. Finally, several months after the initial discovery, he found that non-fluorescent uranium ore could also expose the plates, and he deduced that unknown emanations from the rock samples themselves caused the exposure. The new radiation produced ioniziation, and the intensity of the radioactivity could be measured by this ioniziation. He was also able to demonstrate that a large portion of these rays could be deflected by a magnetic field and were charged particles of the property similar to cathode rays. Marie Curie discovered that not only uranium gave off the mysterious rays discovered by Becquerel, but thorium did as well. Pierre and Marie Curie observed that the intensity of the spontaneuous rays emitted by uranium or thorium increased as the amount of the uranium or thorium increased. Later the couple found that another radioactive element with chemical properties similar to bismuth was present in pitchblende. Marie Curie names this new element "polonium" in honor of her native country. </p>

<p>For the discovery of radioactivity, Bacquerel shared in the 3rd Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 along with Pierre (1859 - 1906) and Marie Curie (1867 - 1934) for their discovery of polonium and radium. <br>Initially referred to as "Bacquerel rays", we now know the emanations he observed were a combination of alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays.</p>

<h2>Nuclear Stability</h2>

<p>At first glance, the existence of several protons in the small space of a nucleus is puzzling. Why wouldn’t the protons be strongly repelled by their like electric charges? The existence of stable nuclei with more than one proton is due to the nuclear force. The <b>nuclear force</b> is <i>a strong force of attraction between nucleons that acts only at very short distances</i> (about 10<sup>−15</sup> m). Beyond nuclear distances, these nuclear forces become negligible. Therefore, two protons that are much farther apart than 10<sup>−15</sup> m repel one another by their like electric charges. Inside the nucleus, however, two protons are close enough together for the nuclear force between them to be effective. This force in a nucleus can more than compensate for the repulsion of electric charges and thereby give a stable nucleus. <br>The protons and neutrons in a nucleus appear to have energy levels much as the electrons in an atom have energy levels. The <b>shell model of the nucleus</b> is a <i>nuclear model in which protons and neutrons exist in levels, or shells, analogous to the shell structure that exists for electrons in an atom</i>. Recall that in an atom, filled shells of electrons are associated with the special stability of the noble gases. The total numbers of electrons for these stable atoms are 2 (for He), 10 (for Ne), 18 (for Ar), and so forth. Experimentally, note that nuclei with certain numbers of protons or neutrons appear to be very stable. These numbers, called magic numbers and associated with specially stable nuclei, were later explained by the shell model. According to this theory, a <b>magic number</b> is t<i>he number of nuclear particles in a completed shell of protons or neutrons</i>. Because nuclear forces differ from electrical forces, these numbers are not the same as those for electrons in atoms. For protons, the magic numbers are 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, and 82. Neutrons have these same magic numbers, as well as the magic number 126. For protons, calculations show that 114 should also be a magic number. Some of the evidence for these magic numbers, and therefore for the shell model of the nucleus, is as follows. Many radioactive nuclei decay by emitting alpha particles, or He-4 nuclei. There appears to be special stability in the He-4 nucleus. It contains two protons and two neutrons; that is, it contains a magic number of protons (2) and a magic number of neutrons (also 2). Another piece of evidence is seen in the final products obtained in natural radioactive decay. For example, uranium-238 decays to thorium-234, which in turn decays to protactinium-234, and so forth. Each product is radioactive and decays to another nucleus until the final product, Pb-206, is reached. This nucleus is stable. Note that it contains 82 protons, a magic number. Other radioactive decay series end at 207 82 Pb and Pb-208, each of which has a magic number of protons. Note that Pb-208 also has a magic number of neutrons (208 = 82 − 126).</p>

<p>Evidence also points to the special stability of pairs of protons and pairs of neutrons, analogous to the stability of pairs of electrons in molecules. Table 20.1 lists the number of stable isotopes that have an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons (157). By comparison, only 5 stable isotopes have an odd number of protons and an odd number of neutrons. <br> When you plot each stable nuclide on a graph with the number of protons (Z) on the horizontal axis and the number of neutrons (N) on the vertical axis, these stable nuclides fall in a certain region, or band, of the graph. The <b>band of stability</b> is <i>the region in which stable nuclides lie in a plot of number of protons against number of neutrons</i>. Figure 20.3 shows the band of stability; the rest of the figure is explained later in this section. For nuclides up to Z = 20, the ratio of neutrons to protons is about 1.0 to 1.1. As Z increases, however, the neutron-to-proton ratio increases to about 1.5. This increase in neutron-to-proton ratio with increasing Z is believed to result from the increasing repulsions of protons from their electric charges. More neutrons are required to give attractive nuclear forces to offset these
repulsions.<br> It appears that when the number of protons becomes very large, the proton–proton repulsions become so great that stable nuclides are impossible. No stable nuclides are known with atomic numbers greater than 83. On the other hand, all elements with Z equal to 83 or less have one or more stable nuclides, with the exception of technetium (Z = 43), as noted in the chapter opening, and promethium (Z = 61).</p>

<p>Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1906–1972) received the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physics for her discovery of the shell structure of the nucleus (independently discovered by the German physicist J. Hans D. Jensen). Notably, she was the second woman to receive the Nobel Prize (Marie Curie was the first). In 1948, Goeppert-Mayer had noticed that the most abundant nuclei were those with special numbers of protons and neutrons. (These special numbers came to be called magic numbers.) Although these numbers had been noted earlier, her work was especially detailed and convincing, and it strongly pointed to a shell structure of the nucleus. According to the shell model of the nucleus, protons and neutrons occupy independent sets of orbitals, similar to those of electrons in atoms. Nucleon orbitals have similar quantum numbers too: <i>n</i> (principal quantum number) and <i>l</i> (orbital angular momentum quantum number). Each nucleon also has a spin of 1/2. Unlike electrons, though, the <i>ℓ</i> quantum number of a nucleon is not restricted by <i>n</i>. It can have any positive integer value, whatever the value of <i>n</i>, beginning with ℓ = 0. For example, the orbitals corresponding to <i>n</i> = 1 are 1<i>s</i>, 1<i>p</i>, 1<i>d</i>, 1<i>f</i>, ... (where <i>s</i> stands for <i>l</i> = 0, <i>p</i> for <i>ℓ</i> = 1, and so forth). A simple scheme based on nucleons oscillating within the nucleus gives energy levels proportional to 2(n − 1) + <i>ℓ</i>, which leads to the following increasing order of energy levels:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>1s, 1p, 1d and 2s (with about the same energies), 1f, ...</p>
</div>

<p>Similar to electrons, an s orbital holds 2 nucleons, a <i>p</i> orbital holds 6 nucleons, a <i>d</i> orbital holds 10 electrons, and an f orbital holds 14 nucleons. Thus it takes 2 nucleons to fill a
1s level, 8 nucleons to fill the 1<i>s</i> and 1<i>p</i> levels, 20 nucleons to fill the 1<i>s</i>, 1<i>p</i>, 1<i>d</i>, and 2<i>s</i> levels, and 34 nucleons to fill the 1<i>s</i>, 1<i>p</i>, 1<i>d</i>, 2<i>s</i> and 1<i>f</i> levels. The numbers 2, 8, and 20 are the first three magic numbers. After that, however, this simple scheme fails.<br> Goeppert-Mayer was able to solve this problem by noting that in nuclei, the orbital angular momentum of each nucleon couples to its spin (equal to 1/2) to give a total angular momentum of either <i>ℓ</i> = 1/2 or <i>ℓ</i> = 1/2. Each level of given ℓ thus splits by this spin-orbit coupling into two sublevels, with the sublevel of angular momentum <i>ℓ</i> = 1/2 being lower in energy. For example, a 1f level is split to give a lower level that Goeppert-Mayer showed can hold 8 nucleons and an upper level that can hold 6 nucleons for a total of 14 for an <i>f</i> shell. Therefore, the magic number after 20 is 20 + 8 = 28 (not 20 + 14 = 34). She was able to show that the shell model reproduced the other magic numbers, as well.</p>
