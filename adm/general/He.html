<h1>Helium</h1>

<p><b>Appearance</b>, colorless gas,<br>
<b>Melting point</b>, 0.95 K ​(−272.20 °C) (at 2.5 MPa)<br>
<b>Boiling point</b>, 4.222 K ​(−268.928 °C) </p>

<p><i>Helium</i> was identifies by its characteristic emission spectrum as a component of the sun before it was found on earth. Helium is the second-lightest element, after hydrogen. Because it is so light, helium in Earth's atmosphere does not stay there very long but floats off into outer space. Because it would be expensive to extract helium from the air, the only way we can get the helium we need is to use our underground. Underground, helium is often found trapped in porous rocks that serve as reservoirs of oil and natural gas. Natural gas is the major commercial source of helium.</p>

<h3>Isolating Helium</h3>

<p>Helium is separated from methane and the other gases in natural gas by a process known as <a href="fractional_distill_liq_air.html">fractional distillation</a>. Fractional distillation separates a mixture of liquids based on the boiling points of each element in the mixture. Every substance has a unique boiling point. Helium's boiling point is -286.94 °C. Its boiling point is lower than that of all other substances. Because helium has such a low boiling point, it is very difficult to liquefy. Therefore, if natural gas is cooled, al of the other gases will turn into liquids first, leaving only helium as a gas. The helium that remains is then pumped off.</p>

<blockquote>
Natural gas is mostly composed of methane, but it also contains concentrations as high as 4% of helium. and many scientist warn that supplies of helium could run out if they continue to be used so quickly.</blockquote>
