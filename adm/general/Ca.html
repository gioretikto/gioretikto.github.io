<h1>Calcium</h1>

<p>Calcium metal is obtained from the reduction of CaO with aluminium</p>

<p>Under the high temperature conditions used, the calcium is formed as a vapour. Calcium metal does not have any large-scale industrial uses, but is used to prepare metals such as zirconium and in the manufacture of calcium hydride. Or it can also be reduced with silicon</p>

<h2>The polymorphs of calcium carbonate</h2>

<p>Calcium carbonate occurs as vast deposits of sedimentary rocks that are formed from the fossilized remains of marine creatures. The most common and stable form is the hexagonal <i>calcite</i>, which has been identified in numerous different crystalline forms. Calcite comprises about 4 per cent by mass of Earth's crust and is formed in many different geological environments. </p>

<p>Calcium carbonate is the most important oxo compound of the elements. It occurs widely in nature as limestone, chalk, marble, and dolomite (with magnesium), and as coral, pearl, and seashell. Calcium carbonate crystallizes in a variery of polymorphs. The most common forms are calcite, aragonite, and vaterite. Calcium carbonate is an important biomineral and a major constituent of bones and shells. It also has widespread use in construction and road building, and is used as an antiacid, and abrasive in toothpaste, in chewing gum, and as health supplement where it is taken to mantain bone density. Powdered limestone is known as <i>agricultar lime</i> and is uded to neutralize acidic soil:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + 2 H<sup>+</sup> ⟶ Ca<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + CO<sub>2</sub> (g) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l)</p>
</div>

<p>Calcite solubility does not only depend on temperature but also on P(CO<sub>2</sub>)</p>

<p>calcite solution: CaCO<sub>3</sub> ⇌ Ca<sup>2+</sup> + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup></p>
<p>Autoprotolysis of water: H<sub>2</sub>O ⇌ H<sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>&minus;</sup></p>
<p>Subsequent reaction: CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> ⇌ HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup></p>

<p>As can be seen from the equations above, an increase of H<sup>+</sup> ions causes a consumption of CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> forming the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> complex. Thereby CaCO<sub>3</sub> dissolution is increased. An increase in H<sup>+</sup> ions can be caused e.g by acids (HCl, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub> but also by an increase of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, since H<sup>+</sup> ions form with the dissolution of CO<sub>2</sub> in water.</p>

<p>CO<sub>2</sb> + H<sub>2</sub>O ⇌ H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> ⇌ H<sup>+</sup> + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup></p>

<p>Calcium carbonate is sparingly soluble in water but its solubility is increased if CO<sub>2</sub> is dissolved in the water, as in rainwater. Thus, caverns have been eroded in limestone rock by the reaction to form the more soluble hydrogencarbonate:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) + CO<sub>2</sub> ⟶ Ca<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + 2HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> (aq)</p>
</div>

<p>This reaction is reversible and over time calcium carbonate stalactites and stalagmites are formed.</p>

<h2>CARBONATE SEDIMENTARY ROCKS</h2>

<p>About 15% of all sedimentary rocks are carbonates. Most of these formed either by precipitation from seawater or by the accumulation of the shelly skeletal parts of sea creatures. Warm shallow seas are the favored environment for the deposition of carbonates. As these waters become warmer, they lose carbon dioxide, and this favors precipitation of calcium carbonate. Warm shallow seas covered vast regions of the continents during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. Carbonate sediment accumulating on the floors of these inland seas entombed millions of ancient marine creatures. </p>

<p>Carbonate rocks contain the minerals calcite and dolomite. <b>Limestone rock</b> (it. calcare) is mostly calcite, CaCO<sub>3</sub>. <b>Dolomite rock</b> is mostly the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, with magnesium content being the difference. Carbonate rocks contain highly variable amounts of impurities, including iron oxide, clay, and particles of sand and silt swept into the environment by currents.</p>

<p>After calcium carbonate particles have accumulated, the particles may grow into a crystalline solid or become otherwise consolidated into rock. Limestones tend to be well stratified, and range in texture from coarsely granular to very fine-grained. <b>Chalk</b> is a powdery limestone contaning calcite from shells of microscopic oceanic plants and animals. The chalk we use to write on chalkboards and sidewalks is mixed with clay to give it more durability. When you draw a line with chalk, you are depositing thousands of particles of soft, porous limestone composed of microscopic skeletal remains of marine plankton (tiny floating sea animals and plants). Another variety is lithographic limestone, a dense rock used in a printing method called lithography (“stone printing”). <br><i>Sulphate chalk</i> produced from natural <b>gypsum</b> which, at first sight, is indistinguishable from natural chalk, which is a hydrated form of calcium sulphate CaSO<sub>4</sub> ⋅ 2H<sub>2</sub>O. This type has asserted itself in many countries over natural chalk. Only 20% of all blackboard chalk crayons, worldwide, are made of calcium carbonate. Even though it is low in solubility, calcium sulfate is largely responsible for the noncarbonate hardness of ground waters </p>

<p>There's alsoio tailor's chalk, whihc is made of talc, known as magnesium silicate. Yet another type of chalk made from magnesium carbonate is used by gymnasts and rock climbers to improve grip by preventing their hands from becoming slippery.</p>

<p>The other widespread carbonate rock is dolomite, which contains the element magnesium. (Remember that there is also a mineral called dolomite.) Dolomite requires effort to distinguish from limestone. The usual field test is to squirt a drop of cold, dilute hydrochloric acid onto the rock. Limestone effervesces (bubbles) readily, but dolomite does so only slightly,
unless scratched to produce a powder. The origin of dolomite is different from limestone. The mineral dolomite is not secreted by organisms, nor does it commonly precipitate from seawater. Instead, dolomite form in the original calcium carbonate sediment when circulating water brings in magnesium atoms that replace some of the calcium atoms.</p>

<p>One harmful effect of <a href="polyprotic_acids.html">acid rain</a> is the deterioration of structures and statues made of marble or limestone, both of which are essentially calcium carbonate. The reaction of calcium carbonate with sulfuric acid yields carbon dioxide, water, and calcium sulfate.</p>

<p>Pure white <b>marble</b> is the result of metamorphism of very pure limestone. Metamorphism involves recrystallization of a preexisting rock, without melting, within the crust. It can be caused by pressure, or temperature, or both. The characteristic swirls and veins of many coulered marble varieties are usually due to various mineral impurities such as clay, slit, sand and ion oxides. </p>
