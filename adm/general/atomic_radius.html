<h1>Atomic Radius</h1>

<p>Just as the size of an orbital cannot be specified exactly, neither can the size of an atom. We must make some arbitrary choices to obtain values for <b>atomic radii</b>. These values can be obtained by measuring the distances between atoms in chemical compounds. For example, in the bromine molecule Br−Br, the distance between the two nuclei is known to be 228 pm. The bromine atomic radius is assumed to be half this distance, or 114 pm. Measurements of this type have led to the values of the atomic radii for the elements shown in Fig. 1. These radii are often called <i>covalent atomic radii</i> because of the way they are determined. These values are significantly smaller than might be expected from the 90% electron density volumes of isolated atoms because when atoms form bonds, their electron “clouds” interpenetrate. However, these values form a self-consistent data set that can be used to discuss the trends in atomic radii. The radii for metal atoms are obtained by halving the distance between metal atoms in solid metal crystals. Note from Fig. 1 that the atomic radius decreases in going from left to right across a period. This decrease can be explained in terms of the increasing effective nuclear charge (decreasing shielding) in going from left to right. This means that the valence electrons are drawn closer to the nucleus, decreasing the size of the atom. Atomic radius increases down a group because of the increases in the orbital sizes in successive principal quantum levels.</p>

<p>Although the chemical properties of the members of a group have many similarities, there are also important differences. The most dramatic differences usually occur between the first and second member. For example, hydrogen in Group 1A is a nonmetal, whereas lithium is a very active metal. This extreme difference results primarily from the very large difference in the atomic radii of hydrogen and lithium, as shown in Fig. 1. Since the small hydrogen atom has a much greater attraction for electrons than do the larger members of
Group 1A, it forms covalent bonds with nonmetals. In contrast, the other members of Group 1A lose their valence electrons to nonmetals to form 11 cations in ionic compounds. <br> The effect of size is also evident in other groups. For example, the oxides of the metals in Group 2A are all quite basic except for the first member of the series; beryllium oxide (BeO) is amphoteric. The basicity of an oxide depends on its ionic character. Ionic oxides contain the O<sup>2−</sup> ion, which reacts with water to form two OH<sup>−</sup> ions. All the oxides of the Group 2A metals are highly ionic except for beryllium oxide, which has considerable covalent character. The small Be<sup>2+</sup> ion can effectively polarize the electron “cloud” of the O<sup>2−</sup> ion, thereby producing significant electron sharing. We see the same pattern in Group 3A, where only the small boron atom behaves as a nonmetal, or sometimes as a semimetal, whereas aluminum and the other members are active metals.</p>

<p>In Group 4A the effect of size is reflected in the dramatic differences between the chemical properties of carbon and silicon. The chemistry of carbon is dominated by molecules containing chains of C−C bonds, but silicon compounds mainly contain SiOO bonds rather than SiOSi bonds. Silicon does form compounds with chains of Si−Si bonds, but these compounds are much more reactive than the corresponding carbon compounds. The reasons for the difference in reactivity between the carbon and silicon compounds are quite complex but are likely related to the differences in the sizes of the carbon and silicon atoms. <br> Carbon and silicon also differ markedly in their abilities to form &pi; bonds. As we discussed in Section 14.1, carbon dioxide is composed of discrete CO<sub>2</sub> molecules with the Lewis structure</p>

<p>are not stable. Instead, the silicon atoms achieve a noble gas configuration by forming four Si−O single bonds.<br>
The importance of &pi; bonding for the relatively small elements of the second period also explains the different elemental forms of the members of Groups 5A and 6A. For example, elemental nitrogen exists as very stable N<sub>2</sub> molecules with the Lewis structure :N≡N:; Elemental phosphorus forms larger aggregates of atoms, the simplest being the tetrahedral P<sub>4</sub> molecules found in white phosphorus (see Fig. 18.18). Like silicon atoms, the relatively large phosphorus atoms do not form strong &pi; bonds but prefer to achieve a noble gas configuration by forming single bonds to several other phosphorus atoms. In contrast, its very strong &pi; bonds make the N<sub>2</sub> molecule the most stable form of elemental nitrogen. Similarly, in Group 6A the most stable form of elemental oxygen is the O<sub>2</sub> molecule with a double bond. However, the larger sulfur atom forms bigger aggregates, such as the cyclic S<sub>8</sub> molecule (see Fig. 18.22), which contain only single bonds.<br> The relatively large change in size in going from the first to the second member of a group also has important consequences for the Group 7A elements. For example, fluorine has a smaller electron affinity than chlorine. This violation of the expected trend can be attributed to the fact that the small size of the fluorine 2<i>p</i> orbitals causes unusually large electron–electron repulsions. The relative weakness of the bond in the F<sub>2</sub> molecule can be explained in terms of the repulsions among the lone pairs, shown in the Lewis structure:</p>

<p>The small size of the fluorine atoms allows close approach of the lone pairs, which leads to much greater repulsions than those found in the Cl<sub>2</sub> molecule with its much larger atoms.</p>
