<h1>Percent Yield</h1>

<p>The maximum amount of product that can be obtained from a chemical reaction is called <b>theoretical yield</b>. Frequently, however, the actual yield of the product—the mass of material that is actually obtained in the laboratory or a chemical plant—is less than the theoretical yield. There can be parallel reactions among the reactants and loss of product often occurs during the isolation and purifi cation steps. In addition, some reactions do not go completely to products, and reactions are sometimes complicated by giving more than one set of products.</p>

<p>The actual yield of product is often given as a percentage of the theoretical yield. This value is called the <b>percent yield</b>:</p>

<p>Suppose you made aspirin in the laboratory by the following reaction:</p>

<table class="noborder">
<tr><td>C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (s)</td> <td>+ C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (l)</td> <td>⟶</td> <td>C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>4</sub></td> <td>+ CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H(l)</td></tr>

<tr><td>salicylic acid</td> <td>acetic anhydride</td> <td></td> <td>aspirin</td> <td>acetic acid</td></tr>

</table>

<p>and that you began with 25.4 g of salicylic acid (C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and an excess of acetic anhydride. That is, salicylic acid is the <b>limiting reactant</b>. If you obtain 17.23 g of aspirin, what is the percent yield of this product? The first step is to find the amount of the limiting reactant, salicylic acid.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>25.4 g / 138.1 g/mol = 0.184 mol C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub></p>
</div>

<p>We see from the balanced equation that from one mole of C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub> one mole of aspirin should be expected. So in this case based on the limiting reactant, C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub> we should expect 0.184 mol of aspirin, which represents the theoretical yield. Because the quantity you measure in the laboratory is the mass of the
product, it is customary to express the theoretical yield as a mass in grams.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>grams of aspirin = 0.184 mol x 180.2 g/mol = 33.15 g</p>
</div>

<p>Finally, with the actual yield known to be only 6.26 g, the percent yield of aspirin can be calculated.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Percent yield = 25.4 g / 33.15 g x 100 = 76.62 %</p>
</div>

<p>Vediamo un altro esempio dato dalla reazione tra Cl<sub>2</sub> e NaOH che a temperatura ambiente danno cloruro e ipoclorito di sodio secondo l'equazione:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Cl<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH ⟶ NaCl + NaClO + H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
</div>

<p>when the reaction occurs at high temperature chlorate forms</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>3Cl<sub>2</sub> + 6 NaOH ⟶ 5NaCl + NaClO<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
</div>

<p>At an intermidiate temperature both reactions occur, and we can evaluate the prevelance of one upon the another by the percent yield.</p>

<div class="def">
<p><b>Example</b> If 100g of CO react witn an excess of H<sub>2</sub> to form 65g CH<sub>3</sub>OH, what's the percentage yield of the reaction?</p>

<p><b>Soluzione</b>. 

<p>THe balanced chemical equation is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>CO + 2 H<sub>2</sub> ⟶ CH<sub>3</sub>OH</p>
</div>

<p>We calculate first the theoretical yield. Knowing the mass of CO, we convert it in moles:</p>

<p>100g CO/ 28g/mol CO = 3.6 mol CO</p>
<br>

<p>from the balanced equation we see that for a mole of CO one of CH<sub>3</sub>OH is formed, so the theoretical maximum is 3.6 mol CH<sub>3</sub>OH which corresponds to</p>


<div class="eq">
<p>grams of CH<sub>3</sub>OH = 3.6 mol x 32g/mol mole CH<sub>3</sub>OH = 115.2 g CH<sub>3</sub>OH</p>
</div>

<p>Percentage yield = 65g CH<sub>3</sub>OH / 115.2 g CH<sub>3</sub>OH x 100% = 56.42% </p>
