<h1>Proposizione I.22</h1>

<p>Proposition I.22 is the converse of the <a href="prop20.html">Triangle Inequality</a>. Though we have
used rays for convenience in several proofs to this point, the proof of Prop. I.22
marks the first instance in which Euclid uses the concept of a ray, although he
does not have a dedicated word for it.</p>

<p><b>Proposizione I.22</b> - Given three line segments for which the length of any one
is exceeded by the sum of the other two, we can form a triangle with sides
congruent to the three segments..</p>

</figure>

<p><i>Proof</i> - Let A, B, C be segments that satisfy the hypothesis of the proposition
so that A &lt; B + C, etc. Let <span class="overline">DE</span> be a ray emanating from some arbitrary point
 D. Take points F, G, H on <span class="overline">DE</span> so that DF ≌ A, FG ≌ B, and GH ≌ C. Form two circles, the first with center F and radius DF , the second with center
G and radius GH. Let K be a point of intersection of the two circles. Since
FK ≌ DF ≌ A, FG ≌ B, and GK ≌ GH ≌ C, ΔFKG is a triangle with sides of the requisite lengths□</p>
