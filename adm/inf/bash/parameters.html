<h1>Positional Parameters</h1>

<p>The most important special, built-in variables are called <i>positional parameters</i>. These hold the command-line arguments to scripts when they are invoked. Positional parameters have the names <b>1, 2, 3</b>, etc., meaning that their values are denoted by <b>$1, $2, $3</b>, etc. There is also a positional parameter <b>0</b>, whose value is the name of the script (i.e., the command typed in to invoke it).</p>

<pre>
a=$1
echo "$1"
</pre>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash

echo "My name is 'basename $0' - I was called as $0"
echo "My first parameter is $1"
echo "My second parameter is $2"
</pre>

<p>invoking <code>./params.sh one two</code>, yields the following output</p>

<pre>
My name is params.sh - I was called as ./params.sh
My first parameter is: one
My second parameter is: two
</pre>

<p>So in general:</p>

<table class="noborder">
<tr><td>bash_script</td> <td>arg1</td> <td>arg2</td> <td>arg3</td> <td>...</td></tr>
<tr><td>$0</td> <td>$1</td> <td>$2</td> <td>$3</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>Two special variables contain all of the positional parameters (except positional parameter 0): <b>*</b> and <b>@</b>. The difference between them is subtle but important, and it's apparent only when they are within double quotes. "$*" is a single string that consists of all of the positional parameters, separated by the first character in the value of the environment variable IFS (internal field separator), which is a space, TAB, and NEWLINE by default. On the other hand, "$@" is equal to "$1" "$2"... "$ N", where N is the number of positional parameters. That is, it's equal to N separate double-quoted strings, which are separated by spaces. If there are no positional parameters, "$@" expands to nothing. We'll explore the ramifications of this difference in a little while.</p>

<p>The variable # holds the number of positional parameters (as a character string). All of these variables are "read-only," meaning that you can't assign new values to them within scripts.</p>

<p>For example, assume that you have the following simple shell script:</p>

<pre>
<code>
echo "alice: $@"
echo "$0: $1 $2 $3 $4"
echo "$# arguments"
</code>
</pre>

<p>Assume further that the script is called alice. Then if you type alice in wonderland, you will see the following
output:</p>

<pre>
<code>
alice: in wonderland
alice: in wonderland
2 arguments
</code>
</pre>

<p>In this case, $3 and $4 are unset, which means that the shell will substitute the empty (or null) string for them.</p>
