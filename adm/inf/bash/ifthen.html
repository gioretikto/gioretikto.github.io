<h1><i>if-then</i> Statement</h1>

<p>The most basic type of structured command is the <i>if-then</i> statement. The <i>if-then</i> statement
has the following format:</p>

<pre>
if command
then
    commands
fi</pre>

<p>If you’re using <i>if-then</i> statements in other programming languages, this format may be somewhat confusing. In other programming languages, the object after the if statement is an equation that is evaluated for a TRUE or FALSE value. That’s not how the bash shell if statement works.</p>


<p>The bash shell <i>if</i> statement runs the command defined on the <i>if</i> line. If the exit status of
the command is zero (the command completed successfully), the commands listed under the then section are executed. If the exit status of the command is anything else, the then commands aren’t executed, and the bash shell moves on to the next command in the script. The <i>fi</i> statement delineates the <i>if-then</i> statement’s end.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple example to demonstrate this concept:</p>

<pre>$ cat test1.sh
#!/bin/bash
# testing the <i>if</i> statement
if pwd
then
echo "It worked"
fi
$
</pre>

<p>This script uses the pwd command on the <i>if</i> line. If the command completes successfully,
the echo statement should display the text string.</p>

<div class="def">
<p><b>Nota</b> You might see an alternative form of the <i>if-then</i> statement used in some scripts:

<pre>if command; then
commands
fi
</pre>

<p>By putting a semicolon at the end of the command to evaluate, you can include the then statement on the same
line, which looks closer to how <i>if-then</i> statements are handled in some other programming languages.</p>
</div>


<h2>The test Command</h2>


<p>So far, all you’ve seen in the <i>if</i> statement line are normal shell commands. You might be
wondering if the bash <i>if-then</i> statement has the ability to evaluate any condition other
than a command’s exit status code.</p>

<p>The <b>test</b> command provides a way to test different conditions in an <i>if-then</i> statement.
If the condition listed in the test command evaluates to TRUE, the test command exits
with a zero exit status code. This makes the <i>if-then</i> statement behave in much the same way that if-then statements work in other programming languages. If the condition is
FALSE, the test command exits with a non-zero exit status code, which causes the <i>if-then</i> statement to exit.</p>


<p>The format of the test command is pretty simple:</p>

<pre>test condition</pre>

<p>The condition is a series of parameters and values that the test command evaluates. When
used in an if-then statement, the test command looks like this:</p>

<pre>if test condition
then
commands
fi
</pre>


<p>It can be used in conjuction with the else block statements:</p>
<pre>$ cat test6.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Testing the test command
#
if test
then
    echo "No expression returns a True"
else
    echo "No expression returns a False"
fi
</pre>


<p>When you add in a condition, it is tested by the test command. For example, using the
test command, you can determine whether a variable has content. A simple condition
expression is needed to determine whether a variable has content:</p>


<pre>$ cat test6.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Testing the test command
#
my_variable="Full"
#
if test $my_variable
then
    echo "The $my_variable expression returns a True"
#
else
    echo "The $my_variable expression returns a False"
fi
</pre>


<p>The bash shell provides an alternative way of testing a condition without declaring the
test command in an if-then statement:</p>
<pre>
if [ condition ]
then
    commands
fi
</pre>

<p>The square brackets define the test condition. Be careful; you must have a space after the
first bracket and a space before the last bracket, or you’ll get an error message.
The test command and test conditions can evaluate three classes of conditions:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>Numeric comparisons</p>
    <li><p>String comparisons</p>
    <li><p> File comparisons</p>
</ul>

<h3>Using numeric comparisons</h3>

<p>The most common test evaluation method is to perform a comparison of two numeric values. The Table below shows the list of condition parameters used for testing two values.</p>

<table>
<th>Comparision</th> <th>Description</th>
<tr><td>n1 -eq n2</td> <td>Checks if n1 is equal to n2</td></tr>

<tr><td>n1 -ge n2</td> <td>Checks if n1 is greater than or equal to n2</td></tr>

<tr><td>n1  -gt n2</td> <td>Checks if n1 is greater than n2</td></tr>

<tr><td>n1 -le n2</td>  <td>Checks if n1 is less than or equal to n2</td></tr>

<tr><td>n1 -lt n2</td> <td>Checks if n1 is less than n2</td></tr>

<tr><td>n1 -ne n2</td>  <td>Checks if n1 is not equal to n2</td></tr>

</table>


<p>The numeric test conditions can be used to evaluate both numbers and variables. Here’s an
example of doing that:</p>

<pre>$ cat numeric_test.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Using numeric test evaluations
#
value1=10
value2=11
#
if [ $value1 -gt 5 ]
then
    echo "The test value $value1 is greater than 5"
fi
#
if [ $value1 -eq $value2 ]
then
    echo "The values are equal"
else
    echo "The values are different"
fi
</pre>
