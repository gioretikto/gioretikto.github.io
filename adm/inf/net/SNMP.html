<h1>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)</h1>

<p><b>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)</b> is a very popular networking protocol that allows IT professionals to remotely monitor and perform device configurations to hosts across a network. <b>SNMP operates on User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</b> service port 161 by default and operates with an SNMP Manager application installed on the IT professionals' computer, an <b>SNMP Ageny</b> operating on the remote host to monitor, and a <b>Management Information Base (MIB)</b>, which the SNMP Agent uses to perform queries and configurations on a device. </p>

<p>An administrator can see what's going on: if a CPU is overloaded on a particular router, if server memory is being over-utilized, and so on, the administrator needs to be warned about these things.</p>
