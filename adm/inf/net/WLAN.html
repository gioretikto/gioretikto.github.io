<h1>Wireless Networks</h1>

<p>WLAN (wireless LAN) technologies, commonly known sa <i>Wi-Fi</i>, function at the lower layers of the <a href="OSI.html">OSI reference Model</a>. WLAN protocols define how frames are transmitted over the air. Wi-Fi is based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, which is part of the IEEE 802 standards (LAN standards), so IEEE 802.11 covers wireless local network standards. WiFi has been used both in ad hoc mode, and infrastructure (AP) mode. Ad-hoc mode is also known as “peer-to-peer” mode. Ad-hoc networks don't require a centralized access point. In AP mode, wireless cient stations (STAs) connect with each other though an Access Points (AP). </p>

<p>The <b>802.11b</b>, which was ratified in 1999 and had been retroactively named Wi-Fi, can transmit data at a theoretical rate of 11 Mbps using 2.4-GHz signals. </p>

<p>The IEEE <b>802.11a</b> standard introduced in 1999, but now widely available commercially until a few years later. Now called WI-fi 2. It uses a 5 GHz band with a theoretical transmission speed of 54 Mbps. This range is less crowded than the 2.4-GHz range and so results in less interference. However signals at the 5-GHz frequency don't travel as far and so these networks require more access points.  </p>

<p><b>802.11g</b> introduced in 2002 and retroactively dubbed Wi-Fi 3 transmits data at a theoretical rate of 54 Mbs using the same 2.4 GHz frequencies used in 802.11b.</p>

<p>The IEEE <b>802.11n</b> standard in 2007 brought some new technologies to the WLAN market. Now called  Wi-Fi 4, 02.11n uses both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency ranges and has a theoretical maximum data rate of 600 Mbs with the actual data rates of roughly 100 to 145 Mbs. In order to support these higher speeds, this standard introduced a technology called MIMO (multiple input multiple output) is a technique in which both the mobile device and the access point have multiple, smart antennae that help to reduce signal interference and reflections.</p>

<p>The IEEE <b>802.11ac</b> published in 2013, includes more advanced MIMO technology called MU-MINO (multi-user MIMO) which supports MIMO transmission to multiple wireless clients at one time. It includes wider channels in the 5 GHz bandwidth (but does not use the 2.4 GHz) and more advanced modulation technique. Data rates may reach the Gigabit threshold.</p>

<p>The most current Wi-Fi standard is 802.11ax, commonly called Wi-Fi 6, which operates in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency ranges. Improvements include MU-MIMO technologies to increase data speeds and transmission distances. A technique called BSS coloring also reduces interference from neighboring Wi-Fi networks. Theoretical maximum speeds reach near 10 Gbps, actual speeds are expected to run about 30-60% faster than Wi-Fi 5. More significantly, however, Wi-Fi 6 can support higher speeds for more network clients at the same time, which is particularly important for smart home environments with potentially dozends of IoT devices, or a stadium or conference center environment with hundreds or thousands of Wi-Fi clients.</P>
