<h1>ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)</h1>

<p>The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses for source hosts that know the IP address of the destination host but not the MAC address. ARP creates an interface between the data link layer and the network layer of the OSI model.</p>

<p>When a host wishes to communicate with another host on the same local network, it needs the destination MAC address in order to compose the basic level 2 frame. When a computer prepares to transmit a packet to a destination on the local network, it checks its ARP table for an IP-to-MAC address resolution for the destination node. If the computer find the address resolution, the source computer uses the information to create the Data Link header with the source and destination MAC address. The packet is then sent directly to the destination node on the local network.</p>

<p>If the source computer does not find an entry for the destination computer's IP address in its ARP table, it initiates an <b>ARP request</b> to gain the destination's MAC address. The source computer 
 broadcasts an ARP request to all hosts on the network. Because the destination address in this discovery packet is a broadcast, every host on the local subnet must process the packet to determine if it is "of interest". The one device that discovers the ARP request broadcast is destined for its IP address, responds to the ARP request.
