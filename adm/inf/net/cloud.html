<h2>Hardware as a service (HaaS) / Software as a service (SaaS) / Data as a service (DaaS)</h2>

<p><b>Hardware as a service (HaaS)</b> is a pay-as-you-go model for accessing a provider’s IT hardware, or even an entire data center. Some companies sell use of their hardware over the Internet on a per-use basis [Wang et al., 2008 |. The user sends data and a program to process that data, while the vendor’s computer does the processing and returns the result. The Haas is flexible, scalable and manageable to meet the user’s needs. An example is the IBM blue cloud project [[BM, 2007 ]. IBM delivers hardware infrastructure, database management, monitoring, security, availability and contingencies to be consumed by clients and partners directly.</p>

<p><b>Software as a service (SaaS)</b> is hosting software or application as a service and provided to customers across the Internet. This mode eliminates the need to install and run the application on the customer’s local computers [Church et al., 2008 |]. SaaS therefore alleviates the customer’s burden of software maintenance, and reduces the expense of software purchases by on-demand pricing. An example of the SaaS is Microsoft’s software plus service, which combines local software and Internet services interacting with one another [Microsoft Corp., 2008 ].</p>

<p><b>Data as a service (DaaS)</b> is related to the fact that users can access remote data in various formats and from multiple sources. And then they operate them just like on a local disk. Typical example is Amazon simple storage service which provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve, declared by Amazon, any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web [Amazon Inc., 2008 ].</p>

<p><b>Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)</b> provides developers with a platform, including all the systems and environments, comprising the end-to-end lifecyle of developing, testing, deploying, and hosting of sophisticated web applications as a service delivered by a cloud base.</p>
