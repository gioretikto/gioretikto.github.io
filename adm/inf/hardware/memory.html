<h1>Memory</h1>

<p>The other fundamental component of a computer, according to the scheme described by Von Neumann, is the memory. Memories are realized by semiconductors devices and are idealized as bit tables whose columns and rows are the memory cells; The smallest unit of memory,called a <i>cell</i>, can be used to store a single bit of data: that is, a logic 0 or a logic 1. Usually, the cells in a memory array are accessed in groups, and each group is called a <i>word</i>. The cells in a word are located in the same horizontal row in the array. A word can contain 8, 16, 32, or even more bits, which depends on the system requirements. </p>

<p>A read cycle begin with a word-line being chose. The word-line will enable all cells in the chosen row. If the memory has 2<sup><i>k</i></sup> rows and 2<sup><i>m</i></sup> columns,m then it has 2<sup>(<i>k</i> + <i>m</i>)</sup> cells. There will be 2<sup><i>k</i></sup> word-lines. These word-loines have to be enables only one at a time. For example, if there are 16 word-lines and we need to enable, the 6th, then we only need to supply the word "0110", to indicate that line number 6 needs to be activated. <br>The operation can be performed by a decoder that accepts <i>k</i>-bits and provides 2<sup><i>k</i></sup> outputs bits. The decoder operates by enabling the word-line indicated by the <i>k</i>-bit word-line indicate by the <i>k</i>-bit word and disabling the rest of the lines. This is the function of the row decoder. <br>When the bits are read, their read values on the bit-line are provided to a column decoder as  shown. The "decoder" picks one out of the 2<sup><i>m</i></sup> colums. Because the column "decoder" performs a 2<sup><i>m</i></sup> x 1 selection, it is actually a multiplexer rather than a decoder. </p>

<figcaption>The diagram shows a simple arrangment of 4 words each having 4 bits. Based on the 2 bit address (A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>) contained in the address line the address decoder actives any one of the word lines, e.g. if the 2 bit address values is (A<sub>0</sub> = 0, A<sub>1</sub> = 1), then out of the 4 word lines (W<sub>0</sub> to W<sub>3</sub>), the word-line W<sub>1</sub> gets selected. This enables all the memory cells connected to that word line.</figcaption>

<p>During a <b>read</b> operation, the data stored in those memory cells i.e. 1001, in the example of the diagrams, gets transferred to the data lines. During a <b>write</b> operation, the data is places on the data lines first and after the word line is activated, the data is transferred to the memory cells. Whereas a read operations is a non-destructive one and retains the previous data, the write operation is destructive and the previous data is lost after it.</p>

<p>Four main kinds of memory can be distinguished, besides the cache memory:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="RAM.html>RAM (Random Access Memory)</a></li>
	<li><p>cache memory: extremely fast memory, built into a computer's CPUT or located next to it on a separate chip. Cache memory is RAM  that a computer microprocessor  can access more quickly than it can access the regular RAM. Altough the RAM is fast, it is not enough for modern computers. The solution is to inser, between processor and RAM, a very quick memory to store the most frequently used data (<i>cache memory</i>). When the processor loads data from the central memory, data are also leaded to the cache; subsequently the data can be quickly read from the cache instead of from the slower central memory.</p></li>

	<li><p>mass memory (hard disk, floppy disk, CD and DVD-ROM, USB), considered as extent peripherals containing permanent data. The memories can be represented as huge tables where each cells contains information (bit sequences) that can represent data or instructions. The information contained in the mass memory is organized in files, each one with its own name and containing data that can be texts, programs, images.</p></li>
