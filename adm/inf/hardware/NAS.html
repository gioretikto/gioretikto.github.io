<h1>NAS (Network Attached Storage)</h1>

<p><b>Network Attached Storage (NAS)</b> is commonly a single device or server attached to a LAN that serves files by using a network protocol, such as Network File System (NFS) or Common Internet FIle System (CFS) to provide an online storage environment. Because it shares the same network as the clients, whene the storage device is accessed, the data transfer occurs on the <i>same</i> LAN as your clients. This if your network is already experiencing heavy utilization, using NAS may further cause degradation in network performance. </p>

<h2>Storage Area Network (NAS)</h2>

<p>Storage Area Networks (SANs) are similar to NAS in topology, with the exception that a SAN is made up of devices on a network, not part of LAN. SAN provides hugh qunatitties of data storage for large networks nad is a much more complicated and expensive technology. </p>
