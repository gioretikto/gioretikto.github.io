<h1>SSDs</h1>

<p><b>Solid State Drives (SSDs)</b> are hard drives that use flash memory technology instead of spinning hard disk platters and magnetic technology; It is called "solid state memory" because there are no moving parts and data is stored as electrical change on the <i>flash memory media</i> located within the SSDs. Data is stored in flash memory chips located inside the drive; The characteristics mean that SSDs (along with the other types of flash memory storage systems) are not subject to mechanical failures like magnetic hard drives and are, therefore, more resistant to shock and viration. They also consume less power, generate less heat, make no noise, and are much faster than magnetic hard drives. </p>

<h3>Floating Gate Transistor</h3>

<p>Flash memory chips are similar to the chips used for RAM but in contrast they are non-volatile− they retain the bits even when the device is powered down. Inside a flash memory chips, transistors turning off or on represent binary 0s and 1s, just as they do in a RAM chip. However, unlike in a RAM chip, the bit remains stored even when the computer is turned off, thanks to a "floating gate". When a signal turns on the transistor, the floating gate becomes electrically charged. The charge remains on the floating gate until a new signal changes it.</p>
