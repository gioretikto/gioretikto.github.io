<h1>ROM (Read only Memory)</h1>

<p><b>ROM (Read only Memory)</b> is a non-volatile permanent memory, the contents of which can be only read but cannot be altered. When the computer is switched on, the RAM is empty. Nevertheless the CPU needs to find from somewhere a sequence of instructions (program) to execute. In each computer is a ROM containing the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System). The BIOS is constituted by programs useful to access data that allow the computer to have some basic instruments available when it is switched on. The BIOS contains a small program transferring the operating system (OS) and other essential data from the mass memory to the central one (loading phase or boot).</p>

<p>A semiconductor ROM cell typically contains a single transistor and a connection point which is grounded. If the connections is closed, then the ROM cell contains a '0' and if the connection if then the ROM cell contains a '1'. </p>

<p>Different types of ROM are distinguished by the methods used to write new data to them and the number of times they can be written:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p><b>ROM</b>: These are the first semiconductor ROMs that contained a pre-programmed set of data or instructions. The contents of the ROM had to be specified before manufacturing the chip, so that the actual data could be used to arrange the transistors inside it.</p></li>

	<li><p><b>PROM (Programmable ROM)</b>: It is purchased in an un-programmed state. Special equipment called a device programmer is then used to write the data into the PROM. The data is written one word at a time by applying an electrical charge to the input pins of the chip. Once a PROM has been programmed in this way, its contents are permanent. As a result, PROMs are also known as one-time programmable memories.</p></li>

	<li><p><b>EPROM</b> (Erasable and Programmable ROM): It is programmed in exactly the same manner as a PROM. However unlike a PROM, EPROMs can be erased and reprogrammed repeatedly. To erase an EPROM it is exposed to a strong source of ultraviolet light. By doing this the entire chip is reset to its initial un-programmed state. (It is also sometimes called an UVEPROM).</p></li>

	<li><p><b>EEPROMs</b> (Electrically Erasable and Programmable ROM): Internally, they are similar to EPROMs, but instead of using UV light, the erase operation is done electrically. Any byte within an EEPROM can be erased and rewritten without the need to reprogram the whole chip, as in an EPROM. (It is pronounced as E<sup>2</sup> PROM).</p></li>
