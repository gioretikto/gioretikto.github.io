<h1>Address Bus</h1>

<p>The <i>address bus</i> is the set of wires that carry the addressing information used to describe the memory location to which the data is being sent or from which the data is being retrieved. As with the data bus, each wire in an address bus carries a single bit of information. This single bit is a single digit in the address.</p>

<p>The more wires (digits) used in calculating these addresses, the greater the total number of address locations. The size (or width) of the address bus indicates the maximum amount of RAM a chip can address.<br> The highway analogy in the previous section, “Data I/O Bus,” can show how the address bus fits in. If the data bus is the highway and the size of the data bus is equivalent to the number of lanes, the address bus relates to the house number or street address. The size of the address bus is equivalent to the number of digits in the house address number. For example, if you live on a street in which the address is limited to a two-digit (base 10) number, no more than 100 distinct addresses (00–99) can exist for that street (10<sup>2</sup>). Add another digit, and the number of available addresses increases to 1,000 (000–999), or 10<sup>3</sup>. Computers use the binary (base 2) numbering system, so a two-digit number provides only four unique addresses (00, 01, 10, and 11), calculated as 2 2 . A three-digit number provides only eight addresses (000—111), which is 2<sup>3</sup>. For example, the 8086 and 8088 processors use a 20-bit address bus that calculates a maximum of 2<sup>20</sup>, or 1,048,576 bytes (1MB), of address locations. Table 3.3 describes the memory-addressing capabilities of processors.</p>

<p>For example the 8085 microprocessor has 16 address pins: It means it has 16 positions to work with -- 0x0000 to 0xFFFF, and each of those 65,536 addresses can point to one byte in RAM, ROM, or to a peripheral. In memory mapped I/O system, peripherals are considered as memory locations.</p>

<p>The data bus and address bus are independent, and chip designers can use whatever size they want for each. Usually, however, chips with larger data buses have larger address buses. The sizes of the buses can provide important information about a chip’s relative power, measured in two important ways. The size of the data bus indicates the chip’s information-moving capability, and the size of the address bus tells you how much memory the chip can handle.</p>
