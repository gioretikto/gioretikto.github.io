<h1>Control Bus</h1>

<p>The control bus is a set of control signals which needs to be activated for activities like writing/reading to/from memory I/O, or special activities of the CPU like <a href="interrupt.html">interrupts</a> and <a href="DMA.html">DMA</a>. Thus, we see signal like Memory Read, I/O Read, Memory Write and Interrupt Acknowledge as part of the control bus. These control signals dictate the actions taking place on the system bus that involve communications with devices like memory or I/O. For example, the Memory Read signal will be asserted for readng from memroy. It is sent to memory from the processor. A signal such as 'Interrupt' received by the processor from an I/O device. Hence in the control bus, we have signals traveling in either direction. Some control lines may be bidirectional too.</p>
