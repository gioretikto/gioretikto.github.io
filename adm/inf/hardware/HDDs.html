<h1>Magnetic Storage of Binary Information − Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)</h1>

<p>The magnetic medie in tapes and hard disks are ferromagnetic materials that store the binary digits (bits) as magnetic domains with switchable directions of magnetizations. This is a "soft" ferromagnet, so that a small imposed magnetic field <i>B</i> can easily establish the ferromagnetic magnetization <i>M</i> along the direction of the applied <i>B</i> field. Both writing and reading operations are accomplished by the "read head". <br> The density of information than can be stored in a magnetic disk is fundamentally limited by the minimum size of a ferromagnetic "domain".</p>

<p>Physically the hard disk consists of one or more platters, each of which has two sides. Each disk surface is coated with the magnetic media. The spindle rotates at 5400, 7200, 10000 or 15000 RPM (revolutions per minute). Each head is a an electromagnetic induction coil. In the "read" mode the head passively passively of the platter "sensing" the changes in </p>

<p>In practice the media are designed to be anisotropic so that permently magnetized domains are easier to create in one plane than others. The axis of magnetization can be arranged to lie either parallel to the plane of the tape or disk, giving rise to <i>longitudinal recordind</i>, or perpendicualr to the plane of the tape or disk, giving rise to <i>vertical recording</i>. The two alternatives are shown below.</p>

<p>A write head magnetises a region by generating a strong local magnetic field, and a read head detects the magnetisation of the regions. Early HDDs used an electromagnet both to magnetise the region and to then read its magnetic field by using electromagnetic induction. Later versions of inductive heads included Metal In Gap (MIG) heads and thin film heads. As data density increased, read heads using magnetoresistance (MR) came into use; the electrical resistance of the head changed according to the strength of the magnetism from the platter. Later development made use of spintronics; in read heads, the magnetoresistive effect was much greater than in earlier types, and was dubbed "giant" magnetoresistance (GMR). In today's heads, the read and write elements are separate, but in close proximity, on the head portion of an actuator arm. The read element is typically magneto-resistive while the write element is typically thin film inductive heads.</p>

<p>The surface of the a disk is divided into imaginary tracks and sectors.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><i>Tracks</i> are concentric circle where the data are stored, so a ring 1 bit wide, and are numbered from the outemost to the innermost ring, starting with zero;</p></li>

	<li><p><b>Cylinder</b> is the collection of one specific track located on each hard disk surface. In other words, it is the area on all of the hard disks inside a hard drive that can be accessed without moving the read/write access mechanism, once it has been move to the proper position;</p></li>

	<li><p><i>Sectors</i> : Tracks are further divided into smaller divisions called sectors. They are the smallest physical storage units on the magneti disk of the HDD. In general each sector of hte hard disk consists of 512 bytes of data. The operating system uses that track and sector numbers to identify the stored information.</p>
