<h1>Data Bus</h1>

<p>The CPU is connected to the memory as well as I/O through the <b>system bus</b>, but only one at time − if the memory and I/O wants to use the bus at the same time, there is a conflict, as there is only one system bus. The system bus comprises of the <a href="address_bus.html">address bus</a>, data bus and the <i>control bus</i>.</p>

<p>The set of lines used to transfer data is called the data bus. It is bidirectional bus, as data has to be sent from the CPU to memory and I/O, and has to be received as well by the CPU. The width of the data bus determines the data transfer rate, size of the internal registers of the CPU and the processing capability of the CPU. In short, it is a reflection of the complexity of the processor. As we see, the 8086 has a data bus width of 16 bits, while the 80486 has a 32-bit bus width. Thus the 80486 can process data of 32 bits at a time while the 8086 can only handle 16 bits.</p>

<p>Data in a computer is sent as digital information in which certain voltages or voltage transitions occurring within specific time intervals represent data as 1s and 0s. You can increase the amount of data being sent (called <i>bandwidth</i>) by increasing either the cycling time or the number of bits being sent at a time, or both. Over the years, processor data buses have gone from 8 bits wide to 64 bits wide. The more wires you have, the more individual bits you can send in the same interval. All modern processors from the original Pentium and Athlon through the latest Core 2, Athlon 64 X2, and even the Itanium and Itanium 2 have a 64-bit (8-byte)-wide data bus. Therefore, they can transfer 64 bits of data at a time to and from the motherboard chipset or system memory.</p>

<p>A good way to understand this flow of information is to consider a highway and the traffic it carries. If a highway has only one lane for each direction of travel, only one car at a time can move in a certain direction. If you want to increase the traffic flow (move more cars in a given time), you can either increase the speed of the cars (shortening the interval between them), add more lanes, or both. As processors evolved, more lanes were added, up to a point. You can think of an 8-bit chip as being a single-lane highway because 1 byte flows through at a time. (1 byte equals 8 individual bits.) The 16-bit chip, with 2 bytes flowing at a time, resembles a two-lane highway. You might have four lanes in each direction to move a large number of automobiles; this structure corresponds to a 32-bit data bus, which has the capability to move 4 bytes of information at a time. Taking this further, a 64-bit data bus is like having an eight-lane highway moving data in and out of the chip.</p>

<p>After 64-bit-wide buses were reached, chip designers found that they couldn’t increase speed further, because it was too hard to synchronize all 64 bits. It was discovered that by going back to fewer lanes, it was possible to increase the speed of the bits (that is, shorten the cycle time) such that even greater bandwidths were possible. Because of this, many newer processors have only 4-bit or 16-bit-wide data buses, yet they have higher bandwidths than the 64-bit buses they replaced.</p>

<p>Another improvement in newer processors is the use of multiple separate buses for different tasks. Traditional processor design had all the data going through a single bus, whereas newer processors have separate physical buses for data to and from the chipset, memory, and graphics card slot(s). </p>
