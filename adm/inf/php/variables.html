<h1>Variables</h1>

<p>A variable is a named container in a PHP script in which a data value can be stored. The stored value can be referenced usign the variable's name and changed (varied) as the script proceeds. The script authro can choose any name for a variable providing it adheres to these three naming conventions:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>names must begin with a $ dollar sing - for example <b>$name</b></p></li>
    <li><p>Name can comprise letter, numnbers, and underscore characters, but not spaces- for example $thi_one.</p></li>
    <li><p>The first character after the $ dollar sign must be a letter or an underscore- it cannot be a number.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>PHP variables are "loosely typed" meaning they can contain data of any type, unlike "strongly typed" variables in some languages where data type must be specified when the variable is created.</p>


<p>A variable is created in a PHP script simply by stating its name. The variable can then be assigned an initial value (initialized) by using the =  assignemente operator to state its value. This statement, and all others in PHP, must end with a semi-colo like this:</p>

<p>$body_temp = 98.6</p>

<p>The value contained within the variable can then be displayed by referencing it using the variable name like this:</p>

<p>echo $body_temp;</p>

<p>Usefully, the variable's value can be displayed as parta of a mixed string by encologin the string and variable name in <u>double quotes</u>:</p>

<p>echo "My body temperature is $body_temp degreed Fahrenheit"</p>

<p>The double quotes ensure that PHP will evaluate the whole string and substitute named variables with their stored values. This feature does not wotk if the string is enclosed in single quotes!</p>
