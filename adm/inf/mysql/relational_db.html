<h1>Relational database concepts</h1>

<p>The most common type of database in use today is the <i>relational database</i>. A relational database management system (RDBMS) stores and retrieves data that is represented in tables. A relational database consists of a collection of tables, similar to a spreadsheet, that store interrelated data. <br> Relational databases are also called <b>SQL databases</b>. SQL stands for <i>Structured Query Language</i> and it’s the language relational databases are written in. SQL is used to execute queries, retrieve data, and edit data by updating, deleting, or creating new records.</p>

<p>This section introduces some of the terms and concepts that are important in talking about relational databases.</p>

<h2>Database tables</h2>

<p>In a relational database, all data is held in <strong>tables</strong>, which are made up of <strong>rows</strong> and <strong>columns</strong>.</p>

<a name="TI214"></a><p>Each table has one or more columns, and each column is assigned
a specific <strong>datatype</strong>, such as an integer number,
a sequence of characters (for text), or a date. Each row in the
table has a value for each column.</p>
<a name="TI215"></a><p>A typical fragment of a table containing employee information
may look as follows:</p>
<a name="TI216"></a><table frame="void" rules="all" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" border="1"><tbody><tr><th valign="bottom" align="left"><a name="TI217"></a><p>emp_ID </p>
</th>
<th valign="bottom" align="left"><a name="TI218"></a><p>emp_lname </p>
</th>
<th valign="bottom" align="left"><a name="TI219"></a><p>emp_fname </p>
</th>
<th valign="bottom" align="left"><a name="TI220"></a><p>emp_phone</p>
</th>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><a name="TI221"></a><p>10057 </p>
</td>
<td valign="top"><a name="TI222"></a><p>Huong </p>
</td>
<td valign="top"><a name="TI223"></a><p>Zhang </p>
</td>
<td valign="top"><a name="TI224"></a><p>1096</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><a name="TI225"></a><p>10693 </p>
</td>
<td valign="top"><a name="TI226"></a><p>Donaldson </p>
</td>
<td valign="top"><a name="TI227"></a><p>Anne </p>
</td>
<td valign="top"><a name="TI228"></a><p>7821</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The tables of a relational database have some important characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li class="fi">There is no significance to
the order of the columns or rows.
</li>
<li class="ds">Each row contains one and only one value for each
column.
</li>
<li class="ds">Each value for a given column has the same type.

</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<a name="TI232"></a><p> The
following table lists some of the formal and informal relational
database terms describing tables and their contents, together with
their equivalent in other nonrelational databases. This manual uses
the informal terms.</p>
<a name="TI233"></a><table frame="void" rules="all" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" border="1"><tbody><tr><th valign="bottom" align="left"><a name="TI234"></a><p>Formal relational term</p>

<a name="TI246"></a><p>When you are designing your database, make sure that each
table in the database holds information about a specific thing,
such as employees, products, or customers.</p>
<a name="TI247"></a><p>By designing a database this way, you can set up a structure
that eliminates redundancy and inconsistencies. For example, both
the sales and accounts payable departments may look up information
about customers. In a relational database, the information about
customers is entered only once, in a table that both departments
can access.</p>
<a name="TI248"></a><p>A relational database is a set of related tables. You use
primary and foreign keys to describe relationships between the information
in different tables.</p>
<a name="DBPFK"></a><h2>Primary and foreign keys</h2>
<a name="TI249"></a><p>Primary and foreign keys define the relational structure of
a database. These keys enable each row in the database tables to
be identified, and define the relationships between the tables.</p>
<a name="DBPKEY"></a><h3>Tables have a primary key</h3>
<a name="TI250"></a><p>All tables in a relational database should have a <strong>primary
key</strong>. The primary key is a column, or set of columns,
that allows each row in the table to be uniquely identified. No
two rows in a table with a primary key can have the same primary
key value.</p>
<a name="TI251"></a><p>If no primary key is assigned, all the columns together become
the primary key. It is good practice to keep your primary key for
each table as compact as possible.</p>
<a name="TI252"></a><h4>Examples</h4>
<a name="TI253"></a><p>In a table holding information about employees, the primary
key may be an ID number assigned to each employee.</p>
<a name="TI254"></a><p>In the sample database, the table of sales order items has
the following columns:</p>
<a name="TI255"></a><p><a name="TI256"></a>
</p><ul>
<li class="fi">An order number, identifying
the order the item is part of
</li>
<li class="ds">A line number, identifying each item on any order
</li>
<li class="ds">A product ID, identifying the product being ordered
</li>
<li class="ds">A quantity, showing how many items were ordered
</li>
<li class="ds">A ship date, showing when the order was shipped

</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<a name="TI257"></a><p>To identify a particular item, both the order number and the
line number are required. The primary key is made up of both these
columns.</p>
<a name="DBFKEY"></a><h3>Tables are related by foreign keys</h3>
<a name="TI258"></a><p>The information in one table is related to that in other tables
by <strong>foreign keys</strong>.</p>
<a name="TI259"></a><h4>Example</h4>
<a name="TI260"></a><p>The sample database has one table holding employee information
and one table holding department information. The department table
has the following columns:</p>
<a name="TI261"></a><p><a name="TI262"></a>
</p><ul>
<li class="fi"><b>dept_id</b>    An ID number for the department. This is the primary
key for the table.</li>
<li class="ds"><b>dept_name</b>    A column holding the name of the department.</li>
<li class="ds"><b>dept_head_id</b>    The employee ID for the department manager.
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<a name="TI263"></a><p>To find the name of a particular employee's department,
there is no need to put the name of the employee's department
into the employee table. Instead, the employee table contains a
column holding the department ID of the employee's department.
This is called a <strong>foreign key</strong> to the department
table. A foreign key references a particular row in the table containing
the corresponding primary key.</p>
<a name="TI264"></a><p>In this example, the employee table (which contains the foreign
key in the relationship) is called the <strong>foreign table </strong>or <strong>referencing
table</strong>. The department table (which contains the referenced
primary key) is called the <strong>primary table </strong>or
the <strong>referenced table</strong>.</p>
<a name="DBOTH"></a><h2>Other database objects</h2>
<a name="TI265"></a><p>A relational database holds more than a set of related tables.
Among the other objects that make up a relational database are:</p>
<a name="TI266"></a><p><a name="TI267"></a>
</p><ul>
<li class="fi"><b>Indexes</b>    Indexes allow quick lookup of information. Conceptually,
an index in a database is like an index in a book. In a book, the
index relates each indexed term to the page or pages on which that
word appears. In a database, the index relates each indexed column
value to the physical location at which the row of data containing
the indexed value is stored.<br>
Indexes are an important design element for high performance,
however their use is transparent to the user.<br>
</li>
<li class="ds"><b>Views</b>    Views are computed tables, or virtual tables. They
look like tables to client applications, but they do not hold data.
Instead, whenever they are accessed, the information in them is
computed from the underlying tables.<br>
The tables that actually hold the information are sometimes
called <strong>base tables </strong>to distinguish them from
views.<br>
</li>
<li class="ds"><b>Stored procedures and triggers</b>    These are routines held in the database itself that
act on the information in the database.<br>
You can create and name your own stored procedures to execute
specific database queries and to perform other database tasks. Stored
procedures can take parameters. For example, you might create a
stored procedure that returns the names of all customers who have
spent more than the amount that you specify as a parameter in the
call to the procedure.<br>
<br>
A trigger is a special stored procedure that automatically
fires whenever a user updates, deletes, or inserts data, depending
on how you define the trigger. You associate a trigger with a table
or columns within a table. Triggers are useful for automatically
maintaining business rules in a database.<br>
</li>
<li class="ds"><b>Users and groups</b>    Each user of a database has a user ID and password.
You can set permissions for each user, so that confidential information
is kept private and users are prevented from making unauthorized
changes. Users can be assigned to groups, in order to make the administration
of permissions easier.</li>
<li class="ds"><b>Java objects</b>    You can install Java classes into the database.
Java classes provide a powerful way of building logic into your
database, and a special class of user-defined datatypes for holding
information.
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<a name="TI268"></a><h2>Queries</h2>
<a name="TI269"></a><p>Retrieve data from a database using the SELECT statement.
The basic query operations in a relational system are projection,
restriction, and join. The SELECT statement implements
all of these operations.</p>
<a name="TI270"></a><p>A <strong>projection </strong>is a subset of the columns
in a table. A <strong>restriction</strong> (also called <strong>selection</strong>)
is a subset of the rows in a table, based on some conditions.</p>
<a name="TI271"></a><p>For example, the following SELECT statement
retrieves the names and prices of all products that cost more than $15: </p>
<a name="TI272"></a><p></p><pre>SELECT name, unit_price<br>FROM product<br>WHERE unit_price &gt; 15 </pre>
<p></p>
<a name="TI273"></a><p>This query uses both a restriction (WHERE unit_price &gt; 15)
and a projection (SELECT name, unit_price)</p>
<a name="TI274"></a><p>A JOIN links the rows in two or more tables by comparing the
values in key columns and returning rows that have matching values.
For example, you may want to select the item identification numbers
and product names for all items for which more than a dozen has
been shipped:</p>
<a name="TI275"></a><p></p><pre>SELECT sales_order_items.id, product.name<br>FROM product KEY JOIN sales_order_items<br>WHERE sales_order_items.quantity &gt; 12</pre>
<p></p>
<a name="TI276"></a><p>The product table and the sales_order_items
table are joined together based on the foreign key relationships
between them.</p>
<a name="TI277"></a><h2>Other SQL statements</h2>
<a name="TI278"></a><p>You can do more with SQL than just query. SQL includes statements
that create tables, views, and other database objects. It also includes
statements that modify tables and commands that perform many other
database tasks discussed in this manual.</p>
<a name="TI279"></a><h2>The system tables</h2>
<a name="TI280"></a><p>Every database contains a set of <strong>system tables</strong>, which
are special tables that the system uses to manage data and the system.
These tables are sometimes called the <strong>data dictionary</strong> or
the <strong>system catalog</strong>.</p>
<a name="TI281"></a><p>System tables contain information about the database. You
never alter the system tables directly in the way that you can alter
other tables. The system tables hold information about the tables
in a database, the users of a database, the columns in each table,
and so on. This information is data about data, or <strong>metadata</strong>. </p>
