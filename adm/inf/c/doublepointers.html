<h1>Pointers to pointers</h1>

<p>We already know that a pointer points to a location in memory and thus used to store address of variables. So, when we define a pointer to pointer. The first pointer is used to store the address of second pointer. That is why they are also known as double pointers.</p>

<h3>How to declare a pointer to pointer in C?</h3>

<p>Declaring Pointer to Pointer is similar to declaring pointer in C. The difference is we have to place an additional ‘*’ before the name of pointer.
Syntax:</p>

<pre>int **ptr2;    // declaring double pointers</pre>

<p>Below diagram explains the concept of Double Pointers:</p>

<p>The above diagram shows the memory representation of a pointer to pointer. The first pointer ptr1 stores the address of the second pointer ptr2 and the second pointer ptr2 stores the address of the variable.</p>

<pre>int main() 
{ 
    int var = 789; 
  
    // pointer for var 
    int *ptr2; 
  
    // double pointer for ptr2 
    int **ptr1; 
  
    // storing address of var in ptr2 
    ptr2 = &var; 
      
    // Storing address of ptr2 in ptr1 
    ptr1 = &ptr2; 
      
    // Displaying value of var using 
    // both single and double pointers 
    printf("Value of var = %d\n", var ); 
    printf("Value of var using single pointer = %d\n", *ptr2 ); 
    printf("Value of var using double pointer = %d\n", **ptr1); 
    
  return 0; 
}  </pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre>
Value of var = 789
Value of var using single pointer = 789
Value of var using double pointer = 789
</pre>
