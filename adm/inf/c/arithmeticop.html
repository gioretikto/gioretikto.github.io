<h1>Arithmetic Operators</h1>

<p>The binary arithmetic operators are <code>+, -, *, /</code>, and the modulus operator <code>%</code>. Integer division truncates any fractional part. The expression <code>x % y</code> produces the remainder when x is divided by y, and thus is zero when y divides x exactly. For example, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, except that years divisible by 400 are leap years. Therefore 

<pre>
if ((year % 4 == 0 &amp;&amp; year % 100 != 0) || year % 400 == 0)
    printf("%d is a leap year\n", year); 
else
    printf("%d is not a leap year\n", year);
</pre>

<p>The % operator cannot be applied to a float or double. The direction of truncation for / and the sign of the result for % are machine-dependent for negative operands, as is the action takenon overflow or underflow.</p>

<p>The binary + and - operators have the same precedence, which is lower than the precedence of *, / and % , which is in turn lower than unary + and -. Arithmetic operators associate left to right.</p>
