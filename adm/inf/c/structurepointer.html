<h1>Declaring and Initializing a Structure Pointer</h1>

<p>Declaration is as easy as can be:</p>

<pre>struct guy * him;</pre>

<p>First is the keyword <i>struct</i>, then the structure tag <i>guy</i>, and then an asterisk ( * ) followed by
the pointer name. The syntax is the same as for the other pointer declarations you have seen.</p>

<p>This declaration does not create a new structure, but the pointer him can now be made to point
to any existing structure of the <i>guy</i> type. For instance, if barney is a structure of the guy type,
you could do this:</p>

<pre>him = &amp;barney;</pre>

<p>Unlike the case for arrays, the name of a structure is not the address of the structure; you need
to use the &amp; operator.</p>

<p>In the example, fellow is an array of structures, which means that fellow[0] is a structure, so
the code initializes him by making it point to fellow[0]:</p>

<pre>him = &amp;fellow[0];</pre>

<p>The first two output lines show the success of this assignment. Comparing the two lines, you
see that him points to <i>fellow[0]</i> , and him + 1 points to fellow[1]. Note that adding 1 to
him adds 84 to the address. In hexadecimal, 874 − 820 = 54 (hex) = 84 (base 10) because each
guy structure occupies 84 bytes of memory: names.first is 20, names.last is 20, favfood is
20, job is 20, and income is 4, the size of float on our system. Incidentally, on some systems,
the size of a structure may be greater than the sum of its parts. That’s because a system’s align-
ment requirements for data may cause gaps. For example, a system may have to place each
member at an even address or at an address that is a multiple of four. Such structures might
end up with unused “holes” in them.</p>
