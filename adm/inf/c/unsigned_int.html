<h1>The Concept of Signed and Unsigned integers</h1>

<p>Sign implies positive or negative. All numbers you work with using a computer are stored in the memory in the form of bits and bytes. A memory location that is 1 byte large contains 8 bits. Each bit can either be a 0 or 1 (that is, carry one of these two values at best). Thus, a memory location that is 1 byte large can contain a maximum of 2 to the power 8 values—that is, 256 unique values. Similarly, a memory location that is 16 bits large can contain 2 to the power 16 values—that is, 65,536 unique values.</p>

<pre>16 bits of			:	 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 = 65535
a unsigned short integer</pre>

<p>How to model negative numbers in this space? One way is to "sacrifice" a bit as the sign-bit that would indicate if the values contained in the other bits are positive or negative (see Figure 3.2). The sign-bit needs to be the most-significant-bit (MSB) as the least-significant-one would be required to model odd numbers. So, when the MSB contains sign-information, it is assumed that 0 would be positive and 1 would mean negative, and the other bytes contain the absolute value.</p>

<pre>
1 | 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
▼					 	▼
Sing Bit				15 bits contain absolute value
0:Indicates positive
1: Indicates negative integer
</pre> 

<p>Thus, a signed number that occupies 8 bits can contain values ranging from -128 through 127, and one that occupies 16 bits can contain values ranging from -32,768 through 32,767. If you look at Table 3.1 again, note that the (<code>signed</code>) short is the type that supports positive and negative integer values in a 16-bit space.</p>
