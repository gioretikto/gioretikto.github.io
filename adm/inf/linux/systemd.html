<h1>systemd</h1>

<p><b>systemd</b> is a system and service manager for Linux. The program <b>systemd</b> is the process with process ID 1 (PID=1). It is responsible for initializing the system in the required way. <code>systemd</code> is started directly by the kernel and resists signal 9, which normally terminates processes. All other programs are either started directly by systemd or by one of its child processes.</p>

<h2>Processes</h2>

<p>A process is a program in execution. The linux system creates a process every time you run an external command, and the process is removed from the system when the command finishes its execution.</p>

<h3>Daemons</h3>

<p>A daemon (also known as background processes) is a program that runs in the background. Almost all daemons have names that end with the letter "<b>d</b>". For example, <b>httpd</b> the daemon that handles the Apache server, or, <b>sshd</b> which handles SSH remote access connections. Linux often start daemons at boot time. Shell scripts stored in /etc/init.d directory are used to start and stop daemons.</p>

<p>Once started, <code>systemd</code> is responsible for launching processes configured to be started at the server's boot time, such as the login shell.</p>

<h2>systemctly</h2>

<p>systemctl is the main tool used to introspect and control the state of the "systemd" system and service manager. You can use systemctl for instance to enable/disable services permanently or only for the current session.</p>
