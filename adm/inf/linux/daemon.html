<h1>Daemon Processes</h1>

<p>On Linux, there are many hidden processes that work quietly in the background to perform a variety of tasks as though by magic. These
are the so-called <i>daemon</i> processes, and they run concurrently with other active user processes.</p>

<blockquote>When a Linux service program runs continually as background process, it's called a <i>daemon</i>.</blockquote>

<pre>
$ ps ax | grep mysql
5793 ?       Sl    0:00 /usr/sbin/mysqld --daemonize --pid
file=/run/mysqld/mysql.pid
 5900 pts/0  S+    0:00 grep --color=auto mysql
</pre>

<p>The <i>mysqld</i> daemon program listen for network connections from clients. When the daemon receives a request from a client, it processes the request and returns data to the client via the same network channel.</p> 

<p>Linux daemon programs often end with the letter <i>d</i> to indicate they're daemon processes. For example,</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>The <b>cron</b> daemon (usually /usr/sbin/crond) executes commands at specified dates and times scheduled through the crontab command (Section ).</p></li>

	<li><p>The <b>httpd</b> Web server (usually /usr/sbin/httpd) is a daemon that handles HTTP requests.</p></li>
* Several daemons, including rpe.nfsd, rpc.lockd, rpc.statd, and rpc.mountd provide the Network Filesystem (NFS) service (Section
).</p></li>
	<li><p>The <b>named</b> (usually /usr/sbin/named) is the Internet DNS server (Section ).</p></li>
	<li><p>The <b>sendmail</b> daemon (usually /usr/sbin/sendmail -bd) is the Internet email server.</p></li>
	<li><p>The <b>sshd</b> daemon (usually /usr/sbin/sshd) is the secure Shell login server.</p></li>
	<li><p>The <i>System Control</i> daemon systemd performs system booting and, after that, manages system processes. The systemct] command is supported by systemd.</p></li>

<p>Many other network servers not listed here run as daemons, but there are also servers, such as the X Window server, that are not
considered daemons. Newer workstations have multiple hardware processors to execute several processes in parallel, resulting in greatly
increased system speed.</p>

<h2>Programming a Daemon</h2>

<p>Daemon programs such as sshd, httpd, and sendmail -bd have these four important characteristics:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>A daemon never exits.</p></li>
	<li><p>A daemon has no control terminal window.</p></li>
	<li><p>A daemon does not use standard I/O.</p></li>
	<li><p>A system daemon is normally started at boot time, is controlled by the init process (process 1), and can be restarted if it dies for some reason.</p></li>
</ol>
