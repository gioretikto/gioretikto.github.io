<h1>Regex</h1>

<p>A regular expression is a pattern that the regular expression engine attempts to match in input text. A pattern consists of one or more character literals, operators, or constructs.</p>

<p>Regexes are most famously used by the <a href="grep.html">grep</a> utility; its name is derived from the <i>ed</i> editor's usage <code>g/regular-expression/p</code>, meaning "global searchg for <i>regular-expression</i> nad print.</p>

<p>A regular expression is written inside a starting slash and an ending slash character: /ce/. This expression looks for a pattern inside a string, where there is an <i>c</i> character, followed by an <i>e</i> character. For the sake of simplicity, suppose our strings are case sensitive.</p>

<h2>The Language Family of Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>When I talk about regular expressions, in practice I mean a family of different dialects. Similarly to genetics, regular expressions keep evolving, and new mutations surface on a regular basis. Although the principles stay the same in most languages, every single dialect brings something different. Standardization of regular expressions began with BRE (Basic Regular Expressions) inside the POSIX standard 1003.2. This standard is used in the editors ed and sed, as well as in the grep command. The first major evolution of regular expressions came with the ERE (Extended Regular Expressions) syntax. This syntax is used in, for example, egrep and notepad++. For completeness, I will also mention the SRE (Simple Regular
Expressions) dialect, which has been deprecated in favor of BRE. Some editors such as EMACS and VIM have their own dialects. In the case of VIM, the dialect can be customized with flags, and this technique provides even more variations. These dialects are built on top of ERE.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>To substitute "мясорубка [myasorubka] tritacarne, carneficina" to "<p><b>мясорубка</b> [myasorubka] tritacarne, carneficina</p>

<pre>^([^\[]+) (\[[^]]+]) (.+)</pre>

<p>with substitution</p>

<pre>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;$1&lt;/b&gt; $2 $3&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
