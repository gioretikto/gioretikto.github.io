<h1>An Introduction to Operating Systems</h1>

<p>Before we discuss how an operating system works, let’s review the basic functions of any computer. A computer’s functions and features can be broken down into the three basic tasks all computers perform: input, processing, and output. Information is input to a computer from a device such as a keyboard or from a storage device such as a hard drive; the central processing unit (CPU) processes the information, and then output is usually created. The following example illustrates the process:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><i>Input</i> − A user running a word-processing program types the letter A on the keyboard, which results in sending a code to the computer representing the letter A.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>Processing</i>— The computer’s CPU determines what letter was typed by looking up the keyboard code in a table.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>Output</i>− The CPU sends instructions to the graphics cards to display the letter A, which is then sent to the computer monitor.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The three functions described above involve some type of computer <b>hardware</b>, but the hardware is controlled and coordinated by the operating system. Without an operating system, every application you use would have to know the details of how to work with each of the hardware devices. Without the operating system to coordinate things, only one application could run at a time. So, you couldn’t open a Web browser while working on a Word document, for example. The operating system can be seen as the go-between for the applications you run and the computer hardware.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, an <b>operating system (OS)</b> is a specialized computer program that provides the following features:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>User interface—The <b>user interface</b> provides a method for users to interact with the computer, usually with a keyboard and mouse or touch screen. A user clicks, touches, or types; the computer processes the input and provides some type of output.</p></li>

	<li><p>File system—The <b>file system</b> is the method by which an OS stores and organizes files and manages access to files on a storage device, such as a hard drive.</p></li>

	<li><p>Processes and services—A <b>process</b> is a program that’s loaded into memory and run by the CPU. It can be an application a user interacts with, such as a word-processing program or a Web browser, or a program with no user interface that communicates with and provides services to other processes. This type of process is usually called a service in Windows and a daemon in Linux, and is said to run in the background because there’s no user interface.</p></li>

	<li><p>Kernel The <b>kernel</b> is the heart of the OS and runs with the highest priority. It schedules processes to run, making sure high-priority processes are taken care of first; manages memory to ensure that two applications don’t attempt to use the same memory space; and makes sure I/O devices are accessed by only one process at a time, in addition to other tasks.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the above OS components are discussed in more detail throughout this book. For now, let’s look more closely at various types of OSs.</p>
