<h2>Making large selections in xterm (and urxvt and Gnome Terminal)</h2>

<p>Suppose that you have a large chunk of output in a terminal window, specifically more than a full screen's worth, and you want to copy it into an email message, text file, or however else you may be logging it for the record. As I knew vaguely but had never really read up on or used until very recently, it turns out that there is a convenient way to do this in xterm. Specifically, this is what the right mouse button is for; it extends the selection from where it is until the current point.</p>

<p>So in xterm what you do to select a huge selection is select a bit right at one end (the start or the end), scroll to the other end, and carefully hit the <b>right mouse button</b> at where you want the selection to end. The selection is instantly extended. You can do this several times if you want, extending the selection each time. Odder and less easily controlled things happen if you hit the right mouse button somewhere inside the selection.</p>
