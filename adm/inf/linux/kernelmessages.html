<h1>kernel Messages</h1>

<p>Whem Linux boots, it displays a large number of messages about the hardware it finds. These messages scroll by so quickly that you're unlikely to be able to read them;
 however, you can review them by typing <code>dmesg | less</code> or print them by typing <code>dmesg | lpr</code>. 
The <code>dmesg</code> command displays the contents of the <i>kernel ring buffer</i>, where kernel messages are stored. This buffer is of limited size, and as the system
continues to operate, the kernel is likely to place additional messages in this buffer. Thus, your original kernel messages may scroll out of the buffer in time. Some
distributions store a copy of the kernel ring buffer as it existed when the computer first booter in a log file, such as <i>/var/log/dmesg</i> (in debian just dmesg).
You should review your kernel ring buffer to familiarize yourself with the messages it contains. You needn't study every detail, but try to spot information on important
subsystems, such as your hard disk, so that you know what types of messages to expect from a working system. In the event of hardware problems, the kernel ring buffer
can be an invaluable resource. You might find that hardware isn't detected (no mention of it appears in the ring buffer), or you might spot error messages relating to
the hardware in the ring buffer.</p>

<p>Boot messages can be found in: /var/log/boot.log<p>

<h2>dmesg</h2>

<p>The dmesg utility displays the kernel-ring buffer, where the kernel stores messages.</p>
