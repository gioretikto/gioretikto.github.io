<h1>Directory structure</h1>

<p>Linux uses a hierarchical filesystem structure. It is similar to an upside-down tree, with the root ( `/` ) at the base of the filesystem. From that point, all the branches (directories) spread throughout the filesystem.</p>

<p>The <b>Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)</b> defines the structure of Unix-like filesystems. However, Linux filesystems also contain some directories that aren't yet defined by the standard.</p>

<h2>Exploring the Linux filesystem from the command line</h2>

<p>Feel free to explore the filesystem yourself by using the tree command. In CentOS 8, it is already installed, but if you use Ubuntu, you will have to install it by using the following command:</p>

<pre>$ sudo apt install tree</pre>

<p>Do not be afraid to explore the filesystem, because no harm will be done by just looking around. Use only the ls command to list the contents of directories.</p>

<p>We will show you an example here, as we will explore some of the directories of the filesystem. Our test machine is using Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS. We will use the tree command by invoking the -L option, which tells the command how many levels down to go, and the last attribute states which directory to start with. Thus, the command will go down one level, starting from the root directory (represented by the forward slash):</p>

<pre>$ tree -L 1 /</pre>

<p>Start exploring the directories from the structure by using the ls command, as shown here. Remember that some of the directories you are about to open will contain a large number of files and/or other directories, which will clutter your terminal window. The following are the directories that exist on almost all versions of Linux. Here's a quick overview of the Linux root filesystem:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>/: Root directory: the root for all other directories.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>/bin</i>: Essential command binaries: the place where binary programs are stored.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>/boot</i>: Static files of the boot loader: the place where the kernel, bootloader, and initramfs are stored.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>/dev</i> : Device files: nodes to the device equipment, a kernel device list.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>/etc</i>: Host-specific system configuration: essential config files for the system, boot time loading scripts, crontab , fstab device storage tables, and the passwd user accounts file.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>/home</i>: the user's home directory: the place where the user's files are stored.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>/lib</i>: Essential shared libraries and kernel modules: shared libraries are similar to Dynamic Link Library (DLL) files in Windows DLLs.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>/media</i>: Mount point for removable media: for external devices and USB external media.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>/mnt</i>: Mount point for mounting a filesystem temporarily: used for legacy systems.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>/opt</i>: Add-on application software packages: the place where optional software is installed.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>/proc</i>: Virtual filesystem managed by the kernel: a special directory structure that contains files essential for the system.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>/sbin</i>: Essential system binaries: vital programs for the system's operation.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>/srv</i>: Data for services provided by this system.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>/tmp</i>: Temporary files.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>/usr</i>: Secondary hierarchy: the largest directory in Linux that contains support files for regular system users; <i>/usr/bin</i> – system executable files; <i>/usr/lib</i> – shared libraries from <i>/usr/bin</i>; <i>/usr/local</i> – source compiled programs not included in the distribution; <i>/usr/sbin</i> – specific system administration programs; <i>/usr/share</i> – data shared by the programs in <i>/usr/bin</i> like config files, icons, wallpapers or sound files; <i>/usr/share/doc</i> – documentation for the system-wide files.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>/var</i>: Variable data: only data that is modifiable by the user is stored here, such as databases, printing spool files, user mail, and others; <i>/var/log</i> – contains log files that register system activity.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Next, we're going to see how to work with these files and directories.</p>
