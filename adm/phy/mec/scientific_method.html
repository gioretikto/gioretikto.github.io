<h1>Scientific method</h1>

<p>Everybody agrees that the modern scientific method is due to Galileo Galilei who understood the importance of <i>experimental physics</i> requiring that a theory must be validated by experimental and measurable evidence. Measurement is defined as “the process of assigning numbers (or values) represent quantities”, by Campbell (1938). </p>

<p>La <b>metrologia</b> è la scienza che si occupa dello studio, dei principi, dei metodi e dei mezzi necessari per effettuare la misurazione di una grandezza fisica. Un <b>campione</b> in metrologia è un oggetto, uno strumento o un sistema di misura, destinato a fornire un riferimento rispetto ad una o più grandezze. Esso ha il compito di definire, realizzare, conservare e riprodurre unità di misura.</p>

<h2>Errors as Uncertainties</h2>

<p>In science, the word <i>error</i> does not carry the usual connotations of the terms mistake or blunder. Error in a scientific measurement means the inevitable uncertainty that
attends all measurements. As such, errors are not mistakes; you cannot eliminate them by being very careful. The best you can hope to do is to ensure that errors are as small as reasonably possible and to have a reliable estimate of how large they are. Most textbooks introduce additional definitions of error, and these are discussed later. For now, error is used exclusively in the sense of uncertainty, and the two words are used interchangeably.</p>

<p>To illustrate the inevitable occurrence of uncertainties, we have only to examine any everyday measurement carefully. Consider, for example, a carpenter who must measure the height of a doorway before installing a door. As a first rough measurement, he might simply look at the doorway and estimate its height as 210 cm. This crude "measurement" is certainly subject to uncertainty. If pressed, the carpenter might express this uncertainty by admitting that the height could be anywhere between 205 cm and 215 cm. <br> If he wanted a more accurate measurement, he would use a tape measure and might find the height is 211.3 cm. This measurement is certainly more precise than his original estimate, but it is obviously still subject to some uncertainty, because it is impossible for him to know the height to be exactly 211.3000 cm rather than 211.3001 cm, for example.<br> This remaining uncertainty has many sources, several of which are discussed in this book. Some causes could be removed if the carpenter took enough trouble. For example, one source of uncertainty might be that poor lighting hampers reading of the tape; this problem could be corrected by improving the lighting. On the other hand, some sources of uncertainty are intrinsic to the process of measurement and can never be removed entirely. For example, let us suppose the carpenter's tape is graduated in half-centimeters. The top of the door probably will not coincide precisely with one of the half-centimeter marks, and if it does not, the carpenter must estimate just where the top lies between two marks. Even if the top happens to coincide with one of the marks, the mark itself is perhaps a millimeter wide; so he must estimate just where the top lies within the mark. In either case,the carpenter ultimately must estimate where the top of the door lies relative to the markings on the tape, and this necessity causes some uncertainty in the measurement. By buying a better tape with closer and finer markings, the carpenter can reduce his uncertainty but cannot eliminate it entirely. If he becomes obsessively determined to find the height of the door with the greatest precision technically possible, he could buy an expensive laser interferometer. But even the precision of an interferometer is limited to distances of the order of the wavelength of light (about 0.5 X 10<sup>−6</sup> meters). Although the carpenter would now be able to measure the height with fantastic precision, he still would not know the height of the doorway <i>exactly</i>. Furthermore, as our carpenter strives for greater precision, he will encounter an important problem of principle. He will certainly find that the height is different in different places. Even in one place, he will find that the height varies if the temperature and humidity vary, or even if he accidentally rubs off a thin layer of dirt. In other words, he will find that there is no such thing as the height of the doorway. This kind of problem is called a <i>problem of definition</i> (the height of the door is not a
well-defined quantity) and plays an important role in many scientific measurements.<br> Our carpenter's experiences illustrate a point generally found to be true, that is, that no physical quantity (a length, time, or temperature, for example) can be measured with complete certainty. With care, we may be able to reduce the uncertainties until they are extremely small, but to eliminate them entirely is impossible. In everyday measurements, we do not usually bother to discuss uncertainties. Sometimes the uncertainties simply are not interesting. If we say that the distance between home and school is 3 miles, whether this means "somewhere between 2.5 and 3.5 miles" or "somewhere between 2.99 and 3.01 miles" is usually unimportant. Often the uncertainties are important but can be allowed for instinctively and without explicit consideration. When our carpenter fits his door, he must know its height with an uncertainty that is less than 1 mm or so. As long as the uncertainty is this small, the door will (for all practical purposes) be a perfect fit, and his concern with error analysis is at an end.</p>

<p>There is always some difficult-to-delete noise which is mized with the measurement result.</p>

<p>The errors that arise in the measurement process can be categorized into either <b>systematic</b> (bias) or <b>random</b> (precision) <b>errors</b>.

<p>As a consequence of random errors, measured values are either above or below the true value. In fact, the most obvious ' signature ' of random errors is a scatter or variability of values obtained through

<b>Random error</b> causes a random variation in measured values found during repeated measurements of the variable.

<p><b>Systematic errors</b> sometimes can be difficult to detect. They can be identified and minimized through <b>calibration</b>, which involves the comparison with a true, known value. They
characterize the accuracy of the measurement. They remain constant with repeated measurements. Hence, they are independent of the number of measurements. The systematic
error, as illustrated in Figure 18.2, is the difference between the true mean value and the sample mean value. In other words, if the estimate of a quantity does not equal the actual
value of that quantity, then the estimate is biased.

<h2>Repeatability and Reproducibility</h2>

<p>Further, all experimentes shall feature <i>Repeatability</i> and <i>Reproducibility</i>.</p>

<p><b>Repeatability</b>: It is the variation in measurements obtained,</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>By one appraiser</p></li>
	<li><p>using one measuring device under the same conditions</p></li>
	<li><p>when used several times</p></li>
	<li><p>while measuring the identical characteristic</p></li>
	<li><p>on the same part</p></li>
	<li><p>in the same environmental condition</p></li>
	<li><p>repetition over a short period of time</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Reproducibility</b>: referes to the closeness of agreement in results obtained from duplicate tests carried out under similar conditions of measurement.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>By different appraisers;</p></li>
	<li><p>in different locations and times;</p></li>
	<li><p>using different equipments;</p></li>
	<li><p>when measuring the identical characteristic</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>reproducibility</i>, can be estimated by comparing each appraiser's average with that of the other that is the standard deviation of the distribution of appraiser averages:</p>

<p>Repeatability is a measure of random error, but ignores systematic errors, whereas reproducibility takes account of both.</p>

<p>Si noti che la ripetibilità e la riproducibilità sono strettamente connesse col concetto e con la proprietà della <b>precisione</b> delle misure; ossia la dispersione dei risultati intorno alla media. La <b>precisione</b> misura generalmente espressa come la deviazione standard, <i>s</i>, o dalla varianza, all'interno di un gruppo omogeneo di campioni e <b>dipende</b> solo da <o>errori casuali</o>. 


<p>L'<b>accuratezza</b> è misurabile come distanza fra valore medio delle misure e valore vero ipotizzato. The standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion or spread of the data points from the mean value. From an experimental point of view, a small standard deciation is indicative of low variability, which is exactly what we want.</p>

<p><b>Uncertainty</b> is an estimante of the range of values within which the true value lies.</p>

Random errors (i.e., uncertainties) are those that cause the result to scatter on both sides of the central value, affecting the precision and accuracy of the result. In contrast, systematic errors cause the results to deviate on the same side from 



When <i>s</i> is large, the measuraments are imprecise</p>



<p><b>Risoluzione</b>: capacità di un dispositivo di misura di distinguere due valori vicini, ma diversi, del misurando.</p>
<p><b>Sensibilità</b>: la minima variazione della grandezza che lo strumento riesce a segnalare.</p>
<p><b>Selettività</b>: indica quantitativamente la capacità del metodo di distinguere l'analita di interesse da possibili interferenti, sulla base del segnale prodotto nelle stesse condizioni analitiche.</p>

<p><b>Errori sistematici</b> (<i>Bias</i>): possono essere dovuti sia all'operatore che allo strumento ed in genere sono difficili da valutare ed eliminare. Gli errori sistematici produce risultati che differiscono dal valore vero sistematicamente sempre nella stessa direzione.</p>
