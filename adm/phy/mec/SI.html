<h1>SI</h1>

<p>The modern international standardization of units started with the French Revolution. In 1791 the Decimal Metric System was officially announced, but it took almost a century for its substantial diffusion and acceptance (and, most important, Napoleon to impose it; in Britain, where his reach was insufficient, the Imperial System is still used, as it is also in the USA). In May 1875, at the “Metre convention”, the representatives of 17 Nations signed an international treaty in Paris. National and international laboratories were created with the mission to develop measurement standards and procedures. This is a very important sector of physics, know as <i>metrology</i>.</p>

<p>To communicate the result of a measurement of a certain physical quantity, a unit for the quantity must be defined. If our fundamental unit of length is defined to be 1.0 meter, for example, and someone familiar with our system of measurement reports that a wall is 2.0 meters high, we know that the height of the wall is twice the fundamental unit of length. Likewise, if our fundamental unit of mass is defined as 1.0 kilogram and we are told that a person has a mass of 75 kilograms, then that person has a mass 75 times as great as the fundamental unit of mass. <br>In 1960 an international committee agreed on a standard system of units for the fundamental quantities of science, called SI (Système International). Its units of length, mass, and time are the meter, kilogram, and second, respectively.</p>

<h2>Length</h2>

<p>In 1799 the legal standard of length in France became the meter, defined as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole. Until 1960, the official length of the meter was the distance between two lines on a specific bar of platinum–iridium alloy stored under controlled conditions. This standard was abandoned for several reasons, the principal one being that measurements of the separation between the lines were not precise enough. In 1960 the meter was defined as 1 650 763.73 wavelengths of orange-red light emitted from a krypton - 86 lamp. In October 1983 this definition was abandoned also, and the meter was redefined as the distance traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 second. This latest definition establishes the speed of light at 299 792 458 meters per second.</p>

<h2>Mass</h2>

<p>The SI unit of mass, the kilogram, is defined as the mass of a specific platinum– iridium alloy cylinder kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures at Sèvres, France (similar to that shown in Fig. 1.1a). As we’ll see in Topic 4, mass is a quantity used to measure the resistance to a change in the motion of an object. It’s more difficult to cause a change in the motion of an object with a large mass than an object with a small mass.</p>

<h2>Time</h2>

<p>Before 1960, the time standard was defined in terms of the average length of a solar day in the year 1900. (A solar day is the time between successive appearances of the Sun at the highest point it reaches in the sky each day.) The basic unit of time, the second, was defined to be (1/60)(1/60)(1/24) = 1/86 400 of the average solar day. In 1967 the second was redefined to take advantage of the
high precision attainable with an atomic clock, which uses the characteristic frequency of the light emitted from the cesium-133 atom as its “reference clock.” The second is now defined as 9 192 631 700 times the period of oscillation of radiation from the cesium atom. The newest type of cesium atomic clock is shown in Figure 1.1b.</p>
