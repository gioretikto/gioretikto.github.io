<h1>Archimede's Principle</h1>

<p>A fundamental principle affecting objects submerged in fluids was discovered by Greek mathematician and natural philosopher Archimedes. Archimedes’ principle can be stated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Any object completely or partially submerged in a fluid is buoyed up by a force with magnitude equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.</blockquote>

<p>Everyone has experienced Archimedes’ principle. It’s relatively easy, for example, to lift someone if you’re both standing in a swimming pool, whereas lifting that same individual on dry land may be a difficult task. Water provides partial support to any object placed in it. We often say that an object placed in a fluid is buoyed up by the fluid, so we call this upward force the <b>buoyant force</b>. The buoyant force is not a mysterious new force that arises in fluids. In fact, the physical cause of the buoyant force is the pressure difference between the upper and lower sides of the object. In Figure 9.15a, the fluid inside the indicated sphere, colored darker blue, is pressed on all sides by the surrounding fluid. Arrows indicate the forces arising from the pressure. Because pressure increases with depth, the arrows on the underside are larger than those on top. Adding them all up, the horizontal components cancel, but there is a net force upward. This force, due to differences in pressure, is the buoyant force <b><i>F<sub>B</sub></i></b>. The sphere of water neither rises nor falls, so the vector sum of the buoyant force and the force of gravity on the sphere of fluid must be zero, and it follows that <i>F<sub>B</sub></i> = <i>Mg</i>, where <i>M</i> is the mass of the fluid. The buoyant force, therefore, is equal in magnitude to the weight of the displaced fluid. <br> Replacing the shaded fluid with a cannon ball of the same volume, as in Figure 1b, changes only the mass on which the pressure acts, so the buoyant force is the same:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>|<i><b>F<sub>B</sub></b></i>| = <i>Mg</i></p>
</div>

<p>where <i>M</i> is the mass of the displaced fluid, <i>not</i> the mass of the cannon ball. The force of gravity on the heavier ball is greater than it was on the fluid, so the cannon ball sinks.</p>

<p><b>Nota bene</b>: la spinta di Archimede non dipende dalla profondità.</p>

<p>Archimedes’ principle can also be obtained from <a href="Stevino.html">Equation 3.1.1</a>, relating pressure and depth, using Figure 9.8b. Horizontal forces from the pressure cancel, but in the vertical direction <i>P</i><sub>2</sub><i>A</i> acts upward on the bottom of the block of fluid, and <i>P</i><sub>1</sub><i>A</i> and the gravity force on the fluid, <i>Mg</i>, act downward, giving</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>F<sub>B</sub></i> = <i>P</i><sub>2</sub><i>A</i> − <i>P</i><sub>1</sub><i>A</i> = <i>Mg</i> &emsp;<b>1</b></p>
</div>

<p>where the buoyancy force has been identified as the result of differences in pressure and is equal in magnitude to the weight of the displaced fluid. This buoyancy force remains the same regardless of the material occupying the volume in question because it’s due to the surrounding fluid. Using the definition of density, Equation 1 becomes</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>F<sub>B</sub></i> = <i>&rho;</i><sub>fluid</sub> <i>V</i><sub>fluid</sub> <i>g</i></p>
</div>

<p>where <i>&rho;</i> fluid is the density of the fluid and <i>V</i> fluid is the volume of the displaced fluid. This result applies equally to all shapes because any irregular shape can be approximated by a large number of infinitesimal cubes. <br>It’s instructive to compare the forces on a totally submerged object with those on a floating object.</p>

<h2>Case I: A Totally Submerged object</h2>

<p>When an object is <i>totally</i> submerged in a fluid of density <i>&rho;</i> fluid, the upward buoyant force acting on the object has a magnitude of <i>B</i> = <i>&rho;</i><sub>fluid</sub> <i>V</i><sub>obj</sub> <i>g</i>, where <i>V</i><sub>obj</sub> is the volume of the object. If the object has density <i>&rho;</i><sub>obj</sub>, the downward gravitational force acting on the object has a magnitude equal to <i>w</i> = <i>mg</i> = <i>&rho;</i><sub>obj</sub> <i>V</i><sub>obj</sub> <i>g</i>, and the net force on it is <i>F<sub>B</sub></i> − <i>w</i> = (<i>&rho;</i><sub>fluid</sub> − <i>&rho;</i><sub>obj</sub>)<i>V</i><sub>obj</sub> <i>g</i>. Therefore, if the density of the object is less than the density of the fluid, the net force exerted on the object is <i>positive</i> (upward) and the object accelerates <i>upward</i>, as in Figures 9.16 and 9.17a. If the density of the object is <i>greater</i> than the density of the fluid, as in Figure 9.17b, the net force is <i>negative</i> and the object accelerates downward.</p>

<h2>Case II: A Floating object</h2>

</figure>

<p>Now consider a partially submerged object in static equilibrium floating in a fluid, as in Figure 2 In this case, the upward buoyant force is balanced by the downward force of gravity acting on the object (Fig. 9.19). If <i>V</i><sub>fluid</sub> is the volume of the fluid displaced by the object (which corresponds to the volume of the part of the object beneath the fluid level), then the magnitude of the buoyant force is given by <i>F<sub>B</sub></i> = <i>&rho;</i><sub>fluid</sub> <i>V</i><sub>fluid</sub> <i>g</i>. Because the weight of the object is <i>w</i> = <i>mg</i> = <i>&rho;</i><sub>obj</sub> <i>V</i><sub>obj</sub> <i>g</i>, and because <i>w</i> = <i>F<sub>B</sub></i>, it follows that <i>&rho;</i> fluid <i>V</i> fluid <i>g</i> = <i>&rho;</i><sub>obj</sub>V<sub>obj</sub><i>g</i>, or</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&rho;</i><sub>obj</sub>/<i>&rho;</i><sub>fluid</sub> = <i>V</i><sub>fluid</sub>/<i>V</i><sub>obj</sub> &emsp;3.3.1</p>
</div>

<p>Equation 3.3.1 neglects the buoyant force of the air, which is slight because the density of air is only 1.29 kg/m<sup>3</sup> at sea level. <br> Under normal circumstances, the average density of a fish is slightly greater than the density of water, so a fish would sink if it didn’t have a mechanism for adjusting its density. By changing the size of an internal swim bladder, fish maintain neutral buoyancy as they swim to various depths. <br> The human brain is immersed in a fluid (the cerebrospinal fluid) of density 1 007 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, which is slightly less than the average density of the brain, 1040 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Consequently, most of the weight of the brain is supported by the buoyant force of the surrounding fluid. In some clinical procedures, a portion of this fluid must be removed for diagnostic purposes. During such procedures, the nerves and blood vessels in the brain are placed under great strain, which in turn can cause extreme discomfort and pain. Great care must be exercised with such patients until the initial volume of brain fluid has been restored by the body. </p>

<p><b>Exercise 1</b>. You place a container of water on a scale and note the reading of 14 kg. A solid sphere of radius 10 cm is dipped into the water and it reemerges to half its volume. What's the reading on the scale now?</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>. If the sphere floats half in, half out of water it's 1/2 the density of water, which is 1g/cm<sup>3</sup> so <i>d</i> = 0.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. So the mass of the sphere is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>m<sub>s</sub></i> = 4&pi;<i>r</i><sup>3</sup>/3 ⋅ <i>d</i> = 4&pi;(10 cm)<sup>3</sup>/3 ⋅ 0.5 = 2094.39 g ~ 2 kg. So the final mass is ~ 16 kg. &emsp;■</p>
