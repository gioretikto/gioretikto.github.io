<h1>The Lagrangian for a system of particle</h1>

<p>Let us now consider a system of particles which interact with one another but with no other bodies. This is called a <i>closed system</i>. It is found that the interaction between the particles can be described by additing to the Lagrangian () for non-interacting particles a certain function of the coordinates, which depends on the nature of the interaction. Denoting this function by -<i>U</i>, we have</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>L</i> = Σ<sub>i</sub> ½<i>m<sub>i</sub>v<sub>i</sub></i><sup>2</sup> - <i>U</i>(<i><b>r</b></i><sub>1</sub>, <i><b>r</b></i><sub>2</sub>, ...)&emsp;(1.6.1)</p>
</div>

<p>where <i><b>r</b></i><sub>i</sub> is the radius vector of the <i>i</i>th particle. This is the general form of the Lagrangian for a closed system. The sum</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>T</i> = Σ<sub>i</sub> ½<i>m<sub>i</sub>v<sub>i</sub></i><sup>2</sup></p>
</div>

<p>is called the <i>kinetic energy</i>, and <i>U</i> the <i>potential energy</i>, of the system.<br> The fact that the potential energy depends only on the positions of the particles at a given instant shows that a change in the position of any particle instantaneously affects all the other particles. We may say that the interaction are instantaneously propagates. The necessity for interactions in classical mechanics to be of this type is closely related to the premises upon which the subject is based, namely of the absolute nature of time and Galilei's relativity principle. If the propagation of interactions were not instantaneuous, but took place with a finite velocity, then that velocity would be different in different frames of reference in relative motion, since the absoluteness of time necessarily implies that the oridnary law of composition of velocities is applicable to all phenomena. The laws of motion for interacting bodies would then be different in different inertial frames, a result which would contradict the relativity principle. <br> In section 1.3 we have treated only the homogeneity of time. The form of the Lagrangian (1.6.1) show that time is both homogeneous and isotropic, i.e. its properties are the same in both direction. For, if <i>t</i> is repalced by −<i>t</i>, the Lagrangian is unchanged, and therefore so are the equations of motion. In other words, if a given motion is possible in a system, the so is the reverse motion (i.e, the motion in which the system passes through the same states in reverse order). In this sense all motions which obey the laws of classical mechanics are reversible. <br> Knowing the Lagrangian, we can derive the equation of motion:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>d/d<i>t</i> (&delta;<i>L</i>/&delta;<i><b>v</b><sub>i</sub></i>) = (&delta;<i>L</i>/&delta;<i><b>r</b><sub>i</sub></i>)</p>
</div>

<p id="New">Subsitution of (1.6.1) gives</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>m<sub>i</sub></i>d<i><b>v<sub>i</sub></b></i>/d<i>t</i> = −(&delta;<i>U</i>/&delta;<i><b>r</b><sub>i</sub></i>)&emsp;(1.6.2)</p>
</div>

<p>In this form the equations of motion are called <i><b>Newton's equations</i></b> and form the basis of the mechanics of a system of interacting particles. The vector</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i><b>F</b></i> = −(&delta;<i>U</i>/&delta;<i><b>r</b><sub>i</sub></i>)</p>
</div>

<p>which appears on the right-hand side of equation (1.6.3) is called the <i>force</i> on the <i>i</i>th particle. Like <i>U</i>, it depends only on the coordinates of the particles, and not on their velocities. The equation (1.6.3) therefore shows that the acceleration vectors of the particles are likewise functions of their coordinates only.<br> The potential energy is defined only to within an additive constant, which has no effect on the equation of motion. This is a particular case of the non-uniqueness of the Lagrangian discussed at the end of section 2. The most natural and most usual way of choosing this constant is such that the potential energy tendos to zero as the distance between the particles tend to infinity. <br> If we use,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>L</i> = Σ<sub>i</sub> ½<i>m<sub>i</sub>v<sub>i</sub></i><sup>2</sup> - <i>U</i>(<i><b>r</b></i><sub>1</sub>, <i><b>r</b></i><sub>2</sub>, ...)&emsp;(1.6.3)</p>
</div>

<p>to describe the motion, arbitrary generalised coordinates <i>q<sub>i</sub></i> instead of Cartesian coordinates, the following transformation is neede to obtain the new Lagrangian:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>x</i> = <i>f<sub>i</sub></i> (<i>q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>q</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., <i>q<sub>s</sub></i>), &emsp; <i>ẋ</i> = &Sigma;<sub><i>k</i></sub> (&delta;<i>f<sub>i</sub></i>/&delta;<i>q<sub>k</sub></i>) <i>q̇<sub>k</sub></i></p>
</div>

<p>Substituting these expression in the function <i>L</i> = &Sigma;<sub>i</sub> (<i>ẋ</i><sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> + <i>ẏ<sub>i</sub></i><sup>2</sup> + <i>ż<sub>i</sub></i><sup>2</sup>) − <i>U</i>, we obtain the required Lagrangian in the form</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>L</i> = ½Σ<sub><i>i,k</i></sub> <i>a<sub>ik</sub></i>(<i>q</i>)<i>q̇<sub>i</sub>q̇<sub>k</sub></i> - <i>U</i>(<i>q</i>) &emsp;(1.6.4)</p>
</div>

<p>where <i>a<sub>ik</sub></i> are functions of the coordinates only. The kinetic energy in the generalised coordinates is still a quadratic function of the velocities, but it may depend on the coordinates also. <br> Hitherto we have spoken only of closed systems. Let us now consider a system <i>A</i> which is not closed and interacts with another system <i>B</i> executing a given motion. In such a case we say that the system <i>A</i> moves in a given external field (due to the system <i>B</i>). Since the equations of motion are obtained from the principle of least action by independently varying each of the coordinates (i.e. by proceeding as if the remainder were given quantities), we can find the Lagrangian <i>L<sub>A</sub></i> of the system <i>A</i> by using the Lagrangian <i>L</i> of the whole system <i>A</i> + <i>B</i> and replacing the coordiantes <i>q<sub>B</sub></i> therein by given functions of time. <br> Assuming that the system <i>A</i> + <i>B</i> is closed, we have <i>L</i> = <i>T<sub>A</sub></i>(<i>q<sub>A</sub>,q̇<sub>A</sub></i>) + <i>T<sub>B</sub></i>(<i>q<sub>B</sub>,q̇<sub>B</sub></i>) − <i>U</i>(<i>q<sub>A</sub>,q<sub>B</sub></i>), where the first two terms are the kinetic energies of the systems A and B and the third term is their combined potential energy. Substituting for q<sub>B</sub> the given functions of time and omitting the term <i>T</i>[<i>q<sub>B</sub></i>(<i>t</i>), <i>q̇<sub>B</sub></i>(<i>t</i>)] which depends on time only, and is therefore the total time derivative of a funciton of time, we obtain L<sub>A</sub> = T<sub>A</sub>(<i>q<sub>A</sub></i>, <i>q̇<sub>A</sub></i>) − <i>U</i>[<i>q<sub>A</sub>,q<sub>B</sub></i>]. Thus the motion of a system in an external field is described by a Lagrangian of the usual type, the onnly difference being that the potentail energy may depend explicitly on time.<br> Foo example, when a single particle moves in an external field, the general form of the Lagrangian is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>L</i> = ½ <i>mv</i><sup>2</sup> − <i>U</i>(<i><b>r</b>, t</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>and the equation of motion is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>m<b>v̇</b></i> = −&delta;<sub>U</sub>/&delta;<b><i>r</i></b></p>
</div>

<p id="uniform">A field such that the same force <b><i>F</i></b> acts on a particle at any point in the field is said to be <i><b>uniform</b></i>. The potential energy in such a field is evidently</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>U</i> = <b><i>F</i></b> ⋅ <b><i>r</i></b></p>
</div>

<p>To conclude this section, we may make the following remarks concerning the application of Lagrange's equations to various problems. It is often necessary to deal with mechanical systems in which the interactions between different bodies (or particles) takes the form of <i>constraints</i>, i.e., restrictions on their relative position. In practice, such constraints are effected by means of rods, strings, hinges and so on. This introduces a new factor into the problem, in that the motion of the bodies results in friction at their points of contact, and the provblem in general ceases to be one of pure mechanics. In many cases, however, the friction in the sytem is so slight that its effect on the motion is entirely negligible. If the masses of the constraining elements of the system are also negligible, the effect of the constraints is simpply to reduce the number of degrees of freedom <i>s</i> of the system to a value less than 3<i>N</i>. To determine the motion of the sytem, the Lagrangian (1.6.5) can again be used, with a set of independent generalised coordinates equal in number to the actual degrees of freedom.</p>
