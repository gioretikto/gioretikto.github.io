<h1>The Hamilton Equations of Motion</h1>

<p>The main idea in hamiltonian dynamics is that instead of using only the coordinates <i>q<sub>i</sub></i>(<i>t</i>) and their derivatives to describe the system, we think of the coordinates <i>q<sub>i</sub></i> and the momenta <i>p<sub>i</sub></i> as independent variables.</p>

<p>This may seem like an odd idea, since once we know the coordinates <i>q<sub>i</sub></i>(<i>t</i>) as a function of time, we also know their time derivatives <i>q̇<sub>i</sub></i>(<i>t</i>), and through that the momenta <i>p<sub>i</sub></i>(<i>t</i>). So how can <i>q</i> and <i>p</i> be considered independent? <br> One way of making sense of this is to note that knowing the position of a body at a particular time does not in itself tell us anything about its velocity (or momentum), or vice-versa. It is only if we know the position at several different times that we will be able to work out its velocity. And the full relation between <i>q</i>(<i>t</i>) and <i>q̇</i>(<i>t</i>), or between <i>q</i>(<i>t</i>) and <i>p</i>(<i>t</i>), can only be known if we know the coordinate <i>q</i>(<i>t</i>) at all times <i>t</i> — but this amounts to having solved the problem of the motion of the body! So in this sense, <i>q</i> and <i>p</i> (or, indeed, <i>q</i> and <i>q̇</i>) can be considered independent variables. Secondly, the relation between coordinates and canonical momenta is not a simple one like the relation between a coordinate and its derivative, but is related to the dynamics of the system as encoded in the lagrangian (or, as we shall see, the hamiltonian). Therefore, it makes sense to consider <i>p</i> as independent of <i>q</i> in a way that <i>q̇</i> cannot be. Thirdly, as you will see in quantum mechanics, the two must be treated as independent quantities there. From the quantum mechanical commutation relations between coordinates and canonical momenta, [<i>q<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>k</sub></i>] = <i>iℏ</i>&delta;<sub>jk</sub> , one can derive Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation, ∆<i>q<sub>i</sub></i>∆<i>p<sub>i</sub></i> ≥ ℏ, which holds for all (<i>q, p</i>) pairs. Therefore, in quantum mechanics, it is impossible to know the coordinate and momentum of a particle at the same time. Also, statistical mechanics, which forms the basis of the modern treatment of thermal physics, is formulated in the phase space where coordinates and momenta are considered as independent variables. So our first step in arriving at the hamiltonian formulation of mechanics will be to use the relation between momenta <i>p<sub>i</sub></i> and velocities <i>q̇<sub>i</sub></i> to eliminate <i>q̇</i>, and write the hamiltonian as a function of coordinates and momenta,</p>

<p>The Lagrangian formulation of mechanics was developed largely in the first two chapters, and most of the subsequent discussion has been in the nature of appliapplication, but still within the framework of the Lagrangian procedure. In this chapchapter we resume the formal development of mechanics, turning our attention to an alternative statement of the structure of the theory known as the Hamiltonian formulation. Nothing new is added to the physics involved; we simply gain another(and more powerful) method of working with the physical principles already esestablished. The Hamiltonian methods are not particularly superior to Lagrangian techniques for the direct solution of mechanical problems. Rather, the usefulness of the Hamiltonian viewpoint lies in providing a framework for theoretical extensions in many areas of physics. Within classical mechanics it forms the basis for further developments, such as Hamilton-Jacobi theory, perturbation approaches and chaos. Outside classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian formulation provides much of the language with which present-day statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics is constructed. We shall assume in the following chapters that the mechanical systems are holonomic and that the forces are monogenic, that is, derived either from a potential dependent upon position only, or from velocity-dependent generalized potentials of the type discussed in Section 1.5.</p>

<p>In the Lagrangian formulation (nonrelativistic), a system with <i>n</i> degrees of freedom possesses <i>n</i> equations of motion of the form</p>

<p>which describe the dynamics of the particles system. In these so-called Lagrange equations, the Lagrange function <i>L</i>, which is the difference between the kineti (<i>T</i>) and potential (<i>V</i>) energies of the system, i.e. <i>L</i> = <i>T</i> − <i>V</i>, appears. The Lagrange function</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>L</i> = <i>L</i>(<i>q, q̇, t</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>As the equations are of second order, the motion of the system is determined for all time only when 2<i>n</i> initial values are specified, for example, the <i>n q<sub>i</sub></i> 's and <i>n q̇<sub>i</sub>'s at a particular time <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, or then <i>n q<sub>i</sub>'s at two times, t<sub>1</sub> and t<sub>2</sub>. We represent the state of the system by a point in an n-dimensional configuration space whose coordinates are the <i>n</i> generalized coordinates <i>q<sub>i</sub></i> and follow the motion of the system point in time as it traverses its path in configuration space. Physically, in the Lagrangian viewpoint a system with n independent degrees of freedom is a problem in <i>n</i> independent variables <i>q<sub>i</sub></i> (<i>t</i>), and <i>q'<sub>t</sub></i> appears only as a shorthand for the time derivative of <i>q<sub>i</sub></i>. All n coordinates must be independent. In the Hamiltonian formulation there can be no constraint equations among the coordinates. If the n coordinates are not independent, a reduced set of m coordinates, with <i>m</i> < <i>n</i>, must be used for the formulation of the problem before proceeding with the following steps. <br> The Hamiltonian formulation is based on a fundamentally different picture. We seek to describe the motion in terms of first-order equations of motion. Since the number of initial conditions determining the motion must of course still be In,
there must be In independent first-order equations expressed in terms of 2<i>n</i> indeindependent variables. Hence, the 2<i>n</i> equations of the motion describe the behavior of the system point in a <a href="gen_coordinates.html#phase">phase space</a> whose coordinates are the In independent variables. In thus doubling our set of independent quantities, it is natural (though not inevitable) to choose half of them to be the n generalized coordinates <i>q<sub>i</sub></i>. As we shall see, the formulation is nearly symmetric if we choose the other half of the set to be the generalized or <i>conjugate momenta p<sub>i</sub></i> already introduced by the definition (cf. Eq. B.44)):</p>

<p>and of timem, <i>t</i>. As the Lagrange equations are of second order in time, 2<i>n</i> initial values are needed to specify the motion of the system. Thes may, e.g., be the <i>n</i> <i>q<sub>i</sub></i>'s and the <i>n</i> <i>q̇<sub>i</sub></i>'s at a particular time or then <i>n</i> <i>q<sub>i</sub></i>'s at two times, <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>.</p>
