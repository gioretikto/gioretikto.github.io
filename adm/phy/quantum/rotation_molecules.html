<h1>The rotation of molecules</h1>

<p>Spectroscopy in the microwave region is concerned with the study of rotating molecules. The rotation of a 3D body may be quite complex and it is convenient to resolve it into rotational components about three mutually perpendicular directions through the centre of gravity − the principal axes of rotation. Thus a body has three principal <i>moments of inertia</i>, one about each axis, ususally designated <i>I<sub>A</sub>, I<sub>B</sub></i> and <i>I<sub>C</sub></i>. <br> Molecules may be classified into groups according to the relative values of their three principal moments of inertia − which, it will be seen, is tantamount to classifying them according to their shapes. We shall describe this classification here before discussing the details of the rotational spectra arising from each group.</p>

	<p>The three directions of rotation may be takes as (a) about the bod axis, (b) end-over.end rotation in the plane of the paper, and (c) end-over-end rotation at right angles to the plane. It is self-evident that the moments of (b) and (c) are the same (i.e <i>I<sub>B</sub></i> = <i>I<sub>C</sub></i>) while that of (a) is very small. As an approximation we may say that <i>I<sub>A</sub></i> = 0, although it should be noted that this <i>is</i> only an approximation. Thus for linear molecules we have:</p>

	<p><i>I<sub>B</sub></i> = <i>I<sub>C</sub></i> &emsp;<i>I<sub>A</sub></i> = 0</p>
