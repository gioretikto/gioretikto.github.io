<h1>The Compton Effect</h1>

<p>The phenomenon which perhaps played the most decisive role in convincing physicists at the turn of the century that light on some occasions displays corcorpuscular character was that which we now call the Compton effect, that is, the collision of X- or 7-rays with electrons. Even though the phenomenon was alalready known, Compton in 1923, carried out the crucial experiments needed to understand it In these, he demonstrated that upon illumination of a body with X-rays, some secondary radiation appeared in addition to the dispersed one. He proved that the wavelength of this secondary ray was independent of the material used in the experiment, depending only on the wavelength of the incident radiradiation and the angle between the incident and secondary rays. He also observed that the wavelength of the secondary radiation was always greater than or equal to that of the incident radiation.<br> Compton himself tried to explain this phenomenon within the framework of the wave theory of light but, finding this impossible, had recourse to a corpuscular theory.</p>

<figcaption>The scattering of a photon by an electron is called the Compton effect. Energy and momentum are conserved in such an event, and as a result the scattered photon has less energy (longer wavelength) than the incident photon. (b) Vector diagram of the momenta and their components of the incident and scattered photons and the scattered electron.</figcaption>

<p>Not only did he accept that light of frequency v is composed of photons with energy <i>E</i>, but also that these photons have momentum <i>p</i>:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>E</i> = <i>h&nu;</i>, &emsp;<i>p</i> = <i>h&nu;</i>/<i>c</i> = <i>h</i> /<i>&lambda;</i> &emsp;(1.1)</p>
</div>

<p>the momentum being in the direction of the classical light ray. Inspection of the relativistic relation between energy and momentum, <i>E</i> = (<i>pc</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>mc</i><sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>, shows that (1.1) is equivalent to supposing that photons are particles with zero rest-mass <i>m<sub>&gamma;</sub></i>. (Experimental evidence confirms that <i>m<sub>&gamma;</sub>c</i><sup>2</sup> < 3 x 10<sup>−33</sup> MeV. <br> The energy of the photons in Compton's experiment was much larger than the binding energy of the electrons in the solid, so that the electrons can be considered to be at rest. Compton applied the energy-momentum conservation laws to the elastic electron-photon collision.</p>

<p>In the initial state, before the collision, we write referring to Fig.1</p>

<table class="noborder centertable">
<tr><th></th> <th>Energy</th> <th>Momentum</th> </tr>
<tr><th>Photon</th> <td><i>E</i><sub>0</sub> = <i>hc</i> /<i>&lambda;</i><sub>0</sub></td> <td><i><b>p</b><sub>0</sub></i> = <i>h<b>u</b><sub>x</sub></i>/<i>&lambda;</i><sub>0</sub></td></tr>
<tr><th>Electron</th> <td><i>E<sub>e</sub></i> = <i>m<sub>e</sub>c</i><sup>2</sup></td> <td><i><b>p</b><sub>e</sub></i> = 0</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>The scattered photon carries energy <i>E</i>'  = <i>h&nu;'</i> and total momentum <i>p</i>' = <i>h&nu;'</i>/<i>c</i> in the direction given by the angle <i>&theta;</i>.  The electron, which was originally at rest, recoils with momentum <i>p</i> in the direction given by the angle <i>&phi;</i>. </p>

<table class="noborder centertable">
<tr><th></th> <th>Energy</th> <th>Momentum</th> </tr>
<tr><th>Photon</th> <td>E<sub>1</sub> = <i>hc</i> /<i>&lambda;</i><sub>1</sub></td> <td><i><b>p</b></i> = <i>h<b>u</b><sub>x</sub></i>/<i>&lambda;</i><sub>1</sub></td> <td>at angle <i>&theta;</i> with respect to <i><b>p</b><sub>0</sub></i></td></tr>
<tr><th>Electron</th> <td>E<sub>2</sub> = <i>m<sub>e</sub>c</i><sup>2</sup></td> <td><i><b>p</b><sub>2</sub></i></td> <td>at angle <i>&phi;</i> with respect to <i><b>p</b><sub>0</sub></i></td></tr>

<p>Applying conservation of energy and <a href="../conservation_momentum.html">momentum</a> as for point particles we get</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>E</i><sub>0</sub> +  <i>E<sub>e</sub></i>  = <i>E</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>E</i><sub>2</sub>, &emsp;&emsp; <i><b>p</b></i><sub>0</sub> = <i><b>p</b></i><sub>1</sub> + <i><b>p</b></i><sub>2</sub></p>
</div>

<p>We rewrite conservation of energy using the relativistic relation</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>p</i><sub>0</sub>  + <i>mc</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> + (<i>pc</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>mc</i><sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup> &emsp;&emsp;⇒&emsp;&emsp; <i>p</i><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> (<i>p</i><sub>0</sub> − <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + 2(<i>p</i><sub>0</sub> − <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>)<i>m<sub>e</sub>c</i></p>
</div>

<p>Conservation of linear momentum, yields</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i><b>p</b></i><sub>2</sub> = <i><b>p</b></i><sub>0</sub> − <i><b>p</b></i><sub>1</sub> &emsp;&emsp;⇒&emsp;&emsp; <i>p</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>p</i><sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> + <i>p</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> − 2<i>p</i><sub>0</sub><i>p</i><sub>1</sub> cos <i>&theta;</i></p>
</div>

<p>By equating the two expression for <i>p</i><sub>2</sub><sup>2</p>, we obtain</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>p</i><sub>0</sub> − <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>p</i><sub>0</sub><i>p</i><sub>1</sub> (1 − cos <i>&theta;)</i>/<i>m<sub>e</sub>c</i></p>
</div>

<p>Expressing photon's momenta in terms of their wavelenghts, we obtain the <b>Compton relation</b></p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&lambda;</i><sub>1</sub> − <i>&lambda;</i><sub>0</sub> = <i>h</i>(1 − cos <i>&theta;</i>)/<i>m<sub>e</sub>c</i></p>
</div>

<p>This equation gives the change in wavelength expected for a photon that is scattered through the angle <i>θ</i> by the electron mass m. This change is independent of the wavelength λ
of incident photon. The scattered photo has a greater wavelenght than the incident photon, as consequence of the transfer of enegery to the electron. The difference &Delta;<i>λ</i> increases with the angle, with  we the greatest wavelength change possible corresponding to θ=180°. </p>

<p>The quantity λ<sub>c</sub> = <i>h</i>/m<sub>e</sub>c, is called the <b>Compton wavelength of the electron</b>. For an electron</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>λ<sub>c</sub></i> = 2.426×10<sup>−12</sup> m</p>
</div>

<p>In terms of λ<sub>c</sub>, Compton relation becomes <i>λ</i>−<i>λ</i>′ = <i>λ<sub>c</sub></i>(1− cos θ).</p>

<p>The Compton effect is consistent with the experimental results confirming the corpuscular behavior of light that had surfaced as a surprise ater Einstein formulated his theory of photoelectric effect.</p>

<h2>Experimental Setup</h2>

<p>A schematic diagram of the apparatus for studying for Compton scattering is shown in Fig.2. A monochromatic beam of K<sub>&alpha;</sub> x-rays of wavelength &lambda;<sub>1</sub> from the molybdenum target were collimated by passing it through the slits <i>L</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>L</i><sub>2</sub>. The collimated beam was then mae incident on a graphite block, G. The graphite block  scattered x-rays in different directions. The scattered x-rays were detected by a Bragg's  x-ray spectrometer. Brag's law was used in determining the wavelength of scattered x-rays. X-rays diffracted by the crystal in the spectrometer were passed through an ionisation chamber to measure their intensity. </p>
