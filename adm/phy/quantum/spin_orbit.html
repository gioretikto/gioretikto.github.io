<h1>Spin-orbit coupling</h1>

<p>An electron is a chraged particle, so its orbital angular momentum gives rise to a magnetic field, just as an electric current in a loop gives rise to a mangetic field in an electromagnet. That is, an electron with orbital angular momentum acts like a tiny bar magnet. An electron also has a sping angular momentum, and this intrinsic 'spinning motion' menas that is also acts as a tiny bar magnet. The magnet arising from the spin interacts with the magnet arising from the orbital motion and gives rise to the interatction called <b>spin-orbit coupling</b>. <br> The two magnets have a higher energy when they are parallel than when they are antiparallel. The total angular momentum <i><b>J</b></i> is the sum of the orbital angular momentum <i><b>L</b></i> and the spin angular momentum <i><b>S</b></i>, <i><b>J</b></i> = <i><b>L</b></i> + <i><b>S</b></i>.</p>

<p>The total orbital angular momentum quantum number, <i>L</i>, tells us the magnitude of the angular momentum through {<i>L</i>(<i>L</i> + 1)}<sup>1/2</sup> ℏ. It has 2<i>L</i> + 1 orientations distinguished by the quantum number <i>M<sub>L</sub></i>, which can take the values <i>L</i>, <i>L</i> − 1, ..., −<i>L</i>. Similar remarks apply to the total <b>spin quantum number</b>, <i>S</i>, and the quantum number <i>M<sub>S</sub></i>, and the total angular momentum quantum number, <i>J</i>, and the quantum number <i>M<sub>J</sub></i>. <br> The value of <i>L</i> (a non-negative integer) is obtained by coupling the individual orbital angular momenta by using the <b>Clebsch–Gordan series</b>:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>L</i> = <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>l</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>l</i><sub>2</sub> − 1, ..., |<i>l</i><sub>1</sub> − <i>l</i><sub>2</sub>|</p>
</div>

<p>The modulus sing are attached to <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> − <i>l</i><sub>2</sub> because <i>L</i> is non-negative. The maximum value, <i>L</i> = <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>l</i><sub>2</sub>, is obtained when the two orbital angular momenta are in the same direction; the lowest value, |<i>l</i><sub>1</sub> − <i>l</i><sub>2</sub>|, is obtained when they are in opposite directions.</p>


<p>The (2<i>L</i> + 1)(2<i>S</i> + 1) states corresponding to eigenstates of <i><b>L</b></i> and <i><b>S</b></i>, denoted by the notation</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><sup>2<i>S</i> + 1</sup><i>L<sub>J</sub></i></p>
</div>

<p>The 2<i>S</i> + 1 term is called the multiplicity of the elctronic state; e.g. the H atom has one unpaired electron so <i>S</i> = 1/2 and the multiplicity of the stae is a doublet. If an atom's electronic state has <i>S</i> = 1 then it is a triplet. The value of <i>L</i> specifies the total angular momentum for the electrons and is given a letter according to the following scheme</p>

<table class="noborder centertable">
<tr><th colspan="6">L</th></tr>

<tr><td>0</td> <td>1</td> <td>2</td> <td>3</td> <td>4</td> <td>5</td> <td>6</td></tr>

<tr><td>S</td> <td>P</td> <td>D</td> <td>F</td> <td>G</td> <td>H</td> <td>I</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>The letter code is the same as that used for the atomic orbitals of different <i>l</i>, but the letters are uppercase. <br> Te quantum number <i>J</i> is a positive number that runs from</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>J</i> = <i>L</i> + <i>S</i>, <i>L</i> + <i>S</i> − 1, ..., |<i>L</i> − <i>S</i>|, &emsp;i.e. there are 2<i>S</i> + 1.</p>
</div>

<p>If there are many electrons having spins in the same direction as their orbital motion, then <i>J</i> is large. If the spins are aligned against the orbital motion, then <i>J</i> is small. Each value of <i>J</i> corresponds to a particular <b>level</b> of a term.</p>

<p>Therefore, because the relative orientation of the magnets reflects the relative orientation of the orbital and spin angular momenta, the energy of the atom depends on the total angular momentum quantum number <i>J</i> (because its value also reflects the relative orientation of the two kinds of momentum). A low energy is obtained when the angular momenta, and therefore the bar mangets, are antiparallel to each other. That arrangement of angular momenta corresponds to a low value of <i>J</i>. Therefore, we can predict that the levl with lowest value of <i>J</i> will lie lowest in energy.</p>

<p>Spin-orbit coupling is a relativistic effect that may be visualized as the action of an effective magnetic field seen by the elctrons while orbiting around the charged nuclei. Seen from the electron, relative motion of the nucleus in an atom corresponds to a ring current that produces a magnetic field along which the electron spin tends to align. The effect increases linearly with teh orbital momentum of the electron, but much more strongly (to the fourth power) with the nuclear charge.</p>
