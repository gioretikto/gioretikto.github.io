<h1>Photoelectron Spectroscopy</h1>

<p>The chemical composition of a surface can be determined by a variety of ionization techniques. The same techniques can be used to detect any remaining contamination after cleaning and to detect layers
of material adsorbed later in the experiment. One technique that may be used is <b>photoemission spectroscopy PES</b>, a derivative of the <a href="photoelectric.html">photoelectric effect</a>, in which X-rays (for XPS) or ultraviolet (for UPS) ionizing radiation is used to eject electrons from adsorbed species. The kinetic energies of the electrons ejected from their orbitals are measured and the pattern of energies is used to identify the material present (Fig. 18.4). UPS, which examines electrons ejected from valence shells, is also used to establish the bonding characteristics and the details of electronic structures of substances on the surface. Its usefulness is its ability to reveal which orbitals of the adsorbate are involved in the bond to the substrate. For instance, the principal difference between the photoemission results on free benzene and benzene adsorbed on palladium is in the energies of the π electrons. This difference is interpreted as meaning that the C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> molecules lie parallel to the surface and are attached to it by their π orbitals. In contrast, pyridine (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N) stands almost perpendicular to the surface, and is attached by a σ bond formed by the nitrogen lone pair.</p>

<p>Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES) is an excellent technique for probing atomic and molecular electronic energy levels. When an atom or molecule is subjected to high-energy radiation, photons in the radiation collide with and eject electron from atoms, leaving behind ions. Ejected electron depart with different velocities and photoelectron spectroscopy measures the veclocity distribution of the released electrons.</p>

<p>The process involved in Photoelectron Spectroscopy is sketched in Fig.1 where the depict a few electron (shown as circles) in some of the energy levels of an atom. Each electorn is held in place by the nucleus with a characteristic <i>binding energy</i> − a term used in this context in preference to <i>ionization potential</i> which is usually taken to mean the <i>least</i> energy required to remove an electron from the <i>highest</i> occupied atomic orbital. For PES we must consider removing an electorn from <i>any</i> orbital − hence the use of the term binding energy. The energy of the photon is imparted to the electron and, if this energy is freater than the BE, the electron will leave the atom and carry with it the excess energy − this it will have a certain kinetic energy (and velocity). Clearly the total energy must be conserved, so we have</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>h&nu;</i> = BE + KE</p>
</div>

<p>It follows that, provided we know the energy of the monochromatic exciting radiation, we can measure the BE of electrons in the atom under examination by observing the KE with whcich they leave. <br> Electrons can be ejected from either the core or the valence levels of hte atom, depending on the energy of the exciting radiation, and their kinetic energies are characteristic of the atom from which they have been emitted. If the atom is part of a molecule, the enegy of its valence electrons (and, to a musch lesser extent, its core electorns) will be modified by the bonding., but are nonetheless characteristic of the orbital in question. <br> When ionization occurs the kinetic energy acquired by the emitted electron is not quantized, so that any incident energy higher than the ionization energy can be used for excitation. Experimetally a monochromatic radiation source is ideal or one with only a few sharp emission frequencies. A helium lamp (emission wavelenght 58.4 nm in the UV region or equivalent photon energy of 21.2 eV) is commonly used for excitation of valence electrons, and the techinique is then referred to as <i>UV-photoelectron spectroscopy</i>, or UPES. A higher energy is required to ionize inner core electrons, for which X-Ray source is sutiable; the techinique is then called <i>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy</i>, (or XPES). In this case the X-ray beam is produced by electron bomardament of a clean metal target, such as Al or Mg, resulting in the emission of radiation at very specific energies; e.g. the <i>k<sub>&alpha;</i> line for Al occurs at 1486.6 eV. If a very high intensity source is required, synchrotron radiation can be used, which has the further advantage that its emission frequency can be tuned over a range.</p>

<p>Experimetally, the detection of lectrons must be carried out in a high vacuum, as electrons are chemically active. There are no known window materials for He lamp sources, and so the lamp is usually mounted in a chamber which has a small hole into the sample compartment through which the emitted rardiation can pass; continuous pumping maintais the high vacuum as helium leaks slowly through the hole. Obviuosly, the requirement for high vacuum means theat measurements on solid samples are far easier than those on liquids and gases. However, modifications such as the use of flow techiniques have ensured that a useful body of data has been obtained for the latter.  </p>
