<h1>Density Matrix</h1>

<p>A <b>density matrix</b> is a matrix that describes the statistical state of a system in quantum mechanics. The density matrix is especially helpful for dealing with mixed states, which consist of a statistical ensemble of several different quantum systems. The opposite of a mixed state is a pure state. State vectors, also called kets, describe only pure states, whereas a density matrix can describe both pure and mixed states. </p>

<p>A mixed state is different from a quantum superposition. The probabilities in a mixed state are classical probabilities (as in the probabilities one learns in classic probability theory / statistics), unlike the quantum probabilities in a quantum superposition. In fact, a <i>quantum superposition</i> of pure states is another pure state, for example | ψ ⟩ = ( | ψ<sub>1</sub> ⟩ + | ψ <sub>2</sub>⟩)/2. In this case, the coefficients 1/2 are not probabilities, but rather probability amplitudes.</p>
