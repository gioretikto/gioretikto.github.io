<h1>The Franck-Condon Principle Predicts the Relative Intensities of Vibronic Transitions</h1>

<p>Figure 1 shows two electronic potential energy curves with the vibrational states associated with each electronic energy state indicated. In each vibrational state, the harmonic-oscillator probability densities are plotted (cf. Figure 5.8). Notice that except for the ground vibrational state, the most likely internuclear separation occurs near the exteme of a vibration, which is called a <i>classical turning point</i> because the vibrational motion changes direction at that point. Because electrons are so much less massive than nuclei, the motion of electrons is almost instantaneous relative to the motion of nuclei. Consequently, when an electron makes a transition from one electronic state to another, the nuclei do not move appreciably during the transition. Electronic transitions can therefore be depicted as vertical lines in a diagram such as in Figure 13.10. This argument can be made rigorous and is known as the <b>Franck-Condon principle</b>. The Franck-Condon principle allows us to estimate relative intensities of vibronic transitions. In Figure 13.10, the minima of the two electronic states lie very nearly above each other. It turns out that the relative intensity of a 0 ⟶ <i>&nu;</i>' transition is proportional to the product of the harmonic-oscillator wave functions in the two vibrational states. Figure 13.10 shows that the overlap of the wave functions in the upper and lower vibronic states varies with v'. Thus, we obtain a distribution of intensities like that shown in Figure 13.1la. </p>

<figcaption>Two electronic potential energy curves showing the vibrational states associated with each electronic state. The minimum of the upper curve lies almost directly over the minimum of the lower curve. The shaded areas represent the harmonic-oscillator probability densities for each vibrational state. The vertical lines represent a series of 0 ⟶ <i>&nu;</i>' vibronic transitions.</figcaption>

<p>However, there can be cases in which, the 0 ⟶ 0 transition is not the most intense transition (See, for example, Figure 13.6 and Table 13.5 for O<sub>2</sub>.)  The most intense transition as shown in Figure 2 is the 0 ⟶ 1 transition, and the distribution of intensities for this case is like that given in Figure 13.11 b. If the excited-state potential curve is displaced to a sufficiently larger internuclear distance than that of the ground-state potential curve, then the absorption spectrum may not contain a line corresponding to &nu;̄<sub>0,0</sub>. The <sup>1</sup>&Sigma;<sub>g</sub><sup>+</sup> ⟶ <sup>3</sup>&Pi; absorption spectrum of I<sub>2</sub> (g), Figure 13.9, is such a case. The bond length increases from 266.6 pm to 302.5 pm as a result of this transition. The 0 ⟶ 0 as well as several other low-energy vibronic transitions are not observed. Performing a detailed analysis of the intensities of such vibronic transitions yields much information about the shapes of electronic potential energy curves.<br> Analyses of electronic spectra yield an exceedingly rich view of molecular structure. As we have seen, structural information of excited electronic states as well as ground electronic states can be obtained. In addition, the selection rules do not require the molecule to have a permanent dipole moment, nor must there be a change in dipole moment upon vibration. Thus, electronic spectroscopy yields information about homonuclear diatomic molecules (such as I<sub>2</sub> (g) in Figure 13.9) that cannot be obtained from either microwave rotational or infrared vibrational absorption spectroscopy. All the parameters given in Table 13.2 can be obtained from electronic spectra.</p>
