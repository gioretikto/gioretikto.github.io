<h1>Plasmon</h1>

<p>A plasmon is a collective oscillation of an entire electron cloud. A plasmon is a density wave in an electron gas. It is analogous to a sound wave, which is a density wave in a gas consisting of molecules. Plasmons can occur in any material with weakly bound or free electrons, but they occur predominantly in metals, particularly ones like Al which have a large Fermi surface and thus a high free-electron density. The free electron gas is part of a quantum system, subject to the periodic potential of the metals ions that make up the lattice.</p>

<blockquote>A plasmon is a quasi particle - a particle that can be described by a collection of interacting particles - in this case, the electrons. Plasmons occur on the surface of a metal, are quantized, and consist of collective oscillations of the three electron gas." it is a boson, so it follows Bose-Einstein statistics and has integer spin.</blockquote>

<h3>PLASMONS AND PHONONS</h3>

<p>We can link these two phenomena because they are both examples of what we call "collective oscillations".</p>

<h2>SPR</h2>

<p>The Rayleigh formula in the previous section has already shown that scattering increases with the particle size. For small nanoparticles absorption therefore predominates. Absorption of light can be traced back to atomic or molecular transitions or to collective phenomena. One of these is the plasmonic oscillations.</p>

<p>Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is the most outstanding optical property of metallic nanostructures. It consists of a collective oscillation of conducting elcetrons in a metal when the electorns are perturbed from their equilibrium positions, for instance, by an electromagnetic wave (light). Upon interaction with light, the free electrons of a metal are driven by the alternating electric field to coherently oscillate at a resonant frequency relative to the lattice of positive ions. Since the penetration depth of an elctronmagnetic wave in a metal surface is limited (&lt; 50 nm for Ag and Au), only plasmons caused by surface electrons are significant and are commonly referred to as <i><b>surface plasmons</b></i>. </p>

<h2>What happens to nanoparticles</h2>

<p>Metallic nanoparticles can be different colors depending on their size. This is because the confinement of the surface plasmon to a small surface, rather than a bulk material, changes the possibile wavelengths that the surface plasmon in a metal can have. Not all wavelenghts are available in a small particle, as they would be in the bulk.</p>

<h3>Plasmon energy equation</h3>

<p>The plasmon energy is described classically:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&omega;<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = Ne<sup>2</sup>/<i>m&epsilon;</i><sub>0</sub>/p>
</div>

<p>Here, &omega;<sub>p</sub> is the plasmon resonance freuency, <i>N</i> is the number density of the electrons (1/m<sup>3</sup>), <i>e</i> is the electron charge, <i>m</i> is the electron mass, and <i>&epsilon;</i><sub>0</sub> is the permettivity of free space. So an increased electron density causes an increase in the plasmon resonance frequency (blue-shift). This helps explain why different materials (like Ag vs. Au) have nanoparticles that are different colors, even if they are the same size and shape.</p>

<p>In metal nanostructure that is much smaller than the wavelength of the incident light, the electromagnetic field can penetrate throughout the volume of the metal. This resulted the free conduction electrons to experience a local restoring exerted by positive ion core inside the volume. The coherently shifting of free electrons in response to the external electric field and subsequently acting restoring force constitute a dipole oscillation having a resonance frequency with that of the incident light. Such coherently oscillating free conduction electrons in metal nanostructures are called as <i>localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)</i>. The induced surface plasmon oscillation generally decays within a few femtoseconds and can be maintained by introducing an laternatic elctric field. The simple free electron oscillation model can explain mosto the the pohenomena associated with surface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles. </p>
