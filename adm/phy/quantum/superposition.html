<h1>Superposition of States</h1>

<p>Quantum superposition is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. The Schrödinger equation is a linear differential equation. If two solutions &psi;<sub>1</sub> and &psi;<sub>2</sub> to the equation exist, the linear superposition &psi; = c<sub>1</sub> &psi;<sub>1</sub> + c<sub>2</sub> &psi;<sub>2</sub> also represents a solution. With |n&gt; being the eigenstate of the time-independent Schrödinger equation Ĥ |n&gt; = E<sub>n</sub> |n&gt;. The most general solution is the linear superposition of all eigenstates </p>

<div class="eq">
<p>|&psi;&#x27e9; = ∑<sub>n</sub> <i>c<sub>n</sub></i>|<i>n</i>&#x27e9;</p>
</div>

<p>An energy measurament (operator Ĥ) on the quantum state |&psi;&gt; forces the system into one of the eigenstates. The probability to find the state |n&gt; by the measurament is given by |c<sub>n</sub>|<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>In quantum mechanics the wave function contains all the information about the particle. Let us assume the wave function for a particle passing though the first and secon slit opening are given repsectively by &psi;<sub>1</sub> and &psi;<sub>2</sub>. If we assume only one of the slits is open, as expected, the probability distribution of the electron intensity on the detector screen is calculated to be a constant</p>

<p align="center">|&psi;|<sup>2</sup> = |&psi;<sub>i</sub>|<sup>2</sup> = &psi;*<sub>i</sub>&psi;<sub>i</sub> =c<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> &emsp; with <i>i</i> =1 or 2</p>

<p>Assume that an electron passes either through slit one or slit two, with both slits open, which also gives a constant probability distribution, contradicting the experimental observation</p>

<p align="center">|&psi;|<sup>2</sup> = |&psi;<sub>1</sub>|<sup>2</sup> + |&psi;<sub>2</sub>|<sup>2</sup> = c<sub>i</sub><sup>1</sup> + c<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Thus, our assumption that the electron is localized and goes through only one slit when both slits are open is wrong. However, a superposition state assumpion the electron wave interacts with both slits simultaneously giving the expected result</p>

<p align="center">|&psi;|<sup>2</sup> = |&psi;<sub>1</sub> + &psi;<sub>2</sub>|<sup>2</p>

<p>Much like waves in classical physics, any two (or more) quantum states can be added together ("superposed") and the result will be another valid quantum state; and conversely, that every quantum state can be represented as a sum of two or more other distinct states. Mathematically, it refers to a property of solutions to the Schrödinger equation; since the Schrödinger equation is linear, any linear combination of solutions will also be a solution. The energy measurament destroys the superposition state and filters out on single energy eigenstate (collapse of the wave function). Superposition states conuniue to exist as long as they are not exposed to an interaction with a measurament probe or, more generally with any kind of external eviroment.</p>

<p>The eigenfunctions of an Hermitian operator (like the Hamiltonian can be shown to form a <i>complete</i> set of orthogonal functions. By “orthogonal” we mean that the product of any two different members of such a set (Ψ<sub>i</sub> and Ψ<sub>k</sub>), when integrated over all space, is zero:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>⟨Ψ<sub>i</sub>|Ψ<sub>k</sub>⟩=0 &emsp; (<b>4</b>)</p>
</div>

<p>The functions sin(x) and sin(2x), for example, are orthogonal.</p>

<p>A general property of eigenvalue equations such as the time-independent Schrödinger equation if that if &psi;<sub>i</sub> is a solution, then so is the product of &psi;<sub>i</sub> with any constant.
This means that we can multiply any non-zero eigenfunction by a suitable factor so that</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>⟨Ψ<sub>i</sub>|Ψ<sub>k</sub>⟩=1 &emsp; (<b>5</b>)</p>
</div>

<p>Such an eigenfunction is said to be <i>normalized</i>, and eigenfunctions that satisfy both Eqs (4) and (5) are called <i>orthonormal</i>.</p>

<p>A complete set of functions of a given variable has the property that a linear combination of its members can be used to construct any well-behaved function of that variable, even if the target functin is not a member of the set. "Well-behaved" in this context means a function that is finite everywhere in a defined interval and has finite first and second derivatives everywhere in this region. Fourier analysis uses this property of the set of sine and cosime functions. </p>

<p>In quantum mechanics, wavefunctions of complex systems often are approximated by combinations of the wavefunctions of simpler or idealized systems. Wavefunctions of time-dependent systems can be described similarly by combining wavefunction of stationary systems in proportions that vary with time.</p>

<p>If Ψ<sub>i</sub> and Ψ<sub>j</sub> are eigenfunctions of an operator, then any linear combination C<sub>i</sub>Ψ<sub>i</sub>+ C<sub>2</sub>Ψ<sub>j</sub> also is an eigenfunction of that operator. A state represented by such a combined wavefunction is called a <i>superposition state</i>. On of the basic tenets of quantum mechanics is that we should use a linear combination of this nature to describe a system whenever we do not know which of its eigenstates the system is in.</p>

<p>The idea of a superposition state gets to the heart of the difference between classical and quantum mechanics. Suppose that a particular experiment always gives result x<sub>1</sub> when it is performed on systems known to be in state 1, and a different result, x<sub>2</sub> , for systems in state 2. We then have (Ψ<sub>i</sub>|X|Ψ<sub>j</sub>) = x<sub>1</sub> and (Ψ<sub>i</sub>|X|Ψ<sub>j</sub>) = x<sub>2</sub>, where Ψ<sub>2</sub> and Ψ<sub>2</sub> are the wavefunctions of thetwo states and X is the operator for the property examined in the experiment. Now suppose further that a given system has probability |C<sub>1</sub>|<sup>2</sup> of being in state 1 and probability |C<sub>2</sub>|<sup>2</sup> of being in state 2. Then, according to classical mechanics, the average result of a large number of measuramens on hte system would be the weighted sum |C<sub>1</sub>|x<sub>1</sub> <sup>2</sup> +  |C<sub>2</sub>|<sup>2</sup>x<sub>2</sub>. However, the individual probabilities do not add in this way for system in a quantum mechanical superposition state. Instead, the expectation value is (C<sub>1</sub>Ψ<sub>1</sub> + C<sub>2</sub> Ψ<sub>2</sub>|X|C<sub>1</sub>Ψ<sub>1</sub> + C<sub>2</sub> Ψ<sub>2</sub>). The classical and quantum mechanical predictions can be very different, because in addition to |C<sub>1</sub>|x<sub>1</sub> <sup>2</sup> +  |C<sub>2</sub>|<sup>2</sup>x<sub>2</sub>, the latter contains an "interference" term, C*<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (Ψ<sub>1</sub>|X|Ψ<sub>2</sub>) + C*<sub>2</sub>C<sub>1</sub> (Ψ<sub>2</sub>|X|Ψ<sub>1</sub>).</p>

<p>One well known illustration of quantum interference is the pattern of bright and dark bans cast on a scr by light that is diffracted at a pair of slits. When Thomas YOung first describes these interference "fringes" in 1804, they seemed to comport well with the wave theory of ligh and to be incompatible with the notion that light consists of particles. Ther are, however, consistent with the particle picture if we accept the idea that a photon passing trhough the slits exists in a superposition state involving both slits until it strikes the screen where it is detected. Because the same pattern of fringes is seen even when the light intensity is reduced so that no more tha tone photon is in transit through the apparatus at any given time, the interference evidently reflects a property of the wavefunction of an individual photon rather than interactions between photons. Similar manifestations of interference have been described for electrons, neutrons, He atoms and even <sup>9</sup>Be<sup>+</sup> ions.</p>
