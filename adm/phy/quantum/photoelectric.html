<h1>The Photoelectric Effect</h1>

<p>During a period spanning the end of the last century and the beginning of the present one, the work of a large number of physicists, notably <i>Hertz, Hallwachs, Stoletow</i> and <i>Lenard</i>, demonstrated the existence of the photoelectric effect: when a metal plate is illuminated by EM radiation, the metal emits electrons. These works empirically established the fundamental laws for this effect;</p>

<ol type="a">
	<li><p>The number of electrons emitted is proportional to the intensity of the incident radiation.</p></li>
	<li><p>For each metal there is a threshold frequency <i>&nu;</i><sub>0</sub>, such that for radiation of frequency <i>&nu;</i> &lt; <i>&nu;</i><sub>0</sub> no electrons are emitted.</p></li>
	<li><p>The maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is proportional to (<i>&nu;</i> − <i>&nu;</i><sub>0</sub>) and is independent of the intensity of the incident radiation.</p></li>
	<li><p>The emission of electrons is practically instantaneous, appearing and disappearing with the EM radiation without measurable delay.
</ol>

<p>Results (b) and (c) are irreconcilable with the wave theory of EM radiation. Einstein, in 1905, compared the expression for the change of entropy with volume of EM radiation obeying <a href="blackbody.html#Wien">Wien's law</a> with the analogous expression for a system of particles. He concluded that monochromatic radiation of frequency <i>&nu;</i> behaves as if it were constituted of a finite number of energy "quanta", localized and independent, of magnitude <i>E</i> = <i>h&nu;</i>. In current nomenclature, first introduced by Lewis, these quanta are called <i>photons</i>.</p>

<p id="Millikan"><i>Millikan</i>  was the first to confirm in detail this brilliant result of Einstein's, by using experiments on the photoelectric effect to measure Planck's constant directly, and finding for <i>h</i> a value coincident with that obtained from the analysis of blackbody radiation. The apparatus used for the study is schematically shown in Fig. 1. Whithin an evacuated glass jacket two electrodes, are enclosed and the light radiation is allowed to enter the jacket through a quartz window. The radiation falls on the cathode electrode. The anode can be kept at positive or negative potential with respect to the cathode. A sensitive ammeter is put in the circuit to record the current resulting from the photoelectrons. The potential difference between the cathode and the anode can be measure by voltmeter. </p>

<figcaption><b>Fig.1</b> Apparatus for studying the photoelectric effect. Photons enter the phototube, strike the cathode, and eject electrons. The photoelectrons are attached to the anode when it is positive with respect to the cathode. When the anode is negative as shows, the electrons are "stopped", and no current passes. The neagtive voltage between the anode and the cathode when the current is zero is the stopping potential.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As long as the voltage <i>V</i> applied between the anode and the cathode is positive, the electrons are drawn from cathode to anode to produce an a current <i>I</i> in the circuit. When the voltage across the phototube is adhjusted so that the anode is slightly negative with respect to the cathode, the photoelectorn are repelled by the anode, though some of the electron have kinetic energy sufficient to overcome the negative potential applied to the anode, and a current is still observed. At a certain value of this negative potential, the current is completely stopped. The least value of this anode potential, <i>V</i><sub>0</sub>, which just stopos the photo current is called <b>cut oof potential</b> or <b>stopping potential</b>. If we multiply the stopping voltage by the charge of the electron, we have a measure of the kinetic energy in joules of the <i>most energetic</i> of the emitted electorns.<p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>E</i><sub>k,max</sub> = <i>eV</i><sub>0</sub> &emsp;(<b>1.1.1</b>)</p>
</div>

<p>Millikan measured the maximum kinetic energy (stopping potential) for different frequencies of the light and obtained a plot Fig. 2 which shows that the distribution of energies of photoelectros varies in a range from 0 to a maximum value known as <i>Fermi energy, E<sub>F</sub></i>.</p>

</figure>

<p>When this experiment is repeated for various frequencies of monochormatic light, the following results are observed:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>For a given material, there is a certain minimum frequency below this threshold, no photoelectric emission will take place, howsoever intense the radiation is;</p></li>
	<li><p>The magnitude of the stopping voltage depends on the frequency of the radiation impinging on the photocatode and on the chemical composition of he coating on the photocatode;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Questa visione classica del fenomeno è in totale disaccordo con le osservazioni sperimentali. Infatti si osserva che, l'energia cinetica degli elettroni emessi non dipende dall'intensità della radiazione incidente. Inoltre l'effetto fotoelettrico si osserva solo con determinate <i>frequnze di soglia, &nu;<sub>0</sub></i>, caratteristiche della superficie metalllica e indipendente dall'intensità. Contrariamente la teoria classica prevede che l'emissione si sarebbe dovuta sostenere a qualsiasi frequenza appatto che l'intensità fosse stata sufficientemente alta. </p>

<p>In Einstein's interpretation, a photoelectron is released as a result of an encounter with a <i>single photon</i>. The entire energy of the photon is delivers instantaneuosly to a <i>single photoelctron</i>. If the photon energy <i>h&nu;</i> is greater than the work function <i>W</i> of the material, the photoelectorn will be relased. If the photon energy is smaller than the work function, the photoelectric effect will not occur. This explantion thus accounts for two of the failures of the wave theory; the existence of the cutoff frequency and the lack of any measurable time delay.<br>If the photon enegy <i>h&nu;</i> exceeds the work function, the excess energy appears as the kinetic energy of the electron:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>E<sub>k,max</sub></i> = <i>h&nu;</i> − <i>W</i> &emsp;(<b>1.1.2</b>)</p>
</div>

<p>la grandezza <i>W</i>, è nota come <i>funzione lavoro</i> (work function) del metallo ed è analoga alla energia di ionizzazione per un atomo isolato. Presenta le unità di misura dell'elettronvolt; Un eV è l'energia acquisita da un elettrone accelerato da una differenza di potenziale di 1V; <br>L'energia minima per provocare l'emissione di un elttrone è pari proprio alla funzione lavoro. By combining 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 we obtain</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>E<sub>k,max</sub></i> = <i>h&nu;</i> − <i>W</i> = <i>eV</i><sub>0</sub> &emsp;⟶&emsp; <i>V</i><sub>0</sub> = <i>h&nu;</i>/<i>e</i> − <i>W</i>/<i>e</i>&emsp;(<b>1.1.3</b>)</p>
</div>

<p>It is thus justified the linearity of <i>V</i><sub>0</sub> with <i>&nu;</i> of the line 1.1.3. It is clear that the phenomenon is observed only if <i>h&nu;</i> &gt; <i>W</i>/<i>h</i> which is the <b>threshold frequency</b></p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&nu;</i><sub>0</sub> = <i>W</i>/<i>h</i></p>
</div>

<p>characteristic of the photocatode coating material.</p>

<p>Initially, Einstein's use of "light particles) encountered quite a bit of opposition because physicists were well aware of the many classical experiments (<a href="../em/diffraction.html">diffraction</a>, for example) proving that light has <i>wavelike</i> properties. It was some time before the mainstream of physicists got used to the idea that photons have <i>both</i> wave and particles properties.</p>
