<h1>Auger Electron Spectroscopy</h1>

<p>XPS and <b>Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)</b> are very closely related; in XPS well look at electrons directly ejected from the inner core of surface atoms. AES is based on a two-step process in which the first step involves the ioniziation of a core level by exposure of x-rays, or, more commonly, using an incident beam of electrons ( > 1keV), because high fluxes of high-energy electrons are easier to obtain. This vacant core level, <i>A</i>, is filled by electron of lower-binding energy, <i>B</i>, which may give up its energy to another electron in state <i>C</i>, which is ejected in the Auger effect, with kinetic energy</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>E</i><sub>kin</sub> = <i>E<sub>A</sub></i> − <i>E<sub>B</sub></i> − <i>E<sub>C</sub></i></p>
</div>

<p>The energy released by the electron falling from state <i>B</i> into the core hole at <i>A</i> is given to an emitted photon with energy</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>h&nu;</i> = <i>E<sub>A</sub></i> − <i>E<sub>B</sub></i></p>
</div>

<p>This is the same decay process as that occuiring in <a href="../../chemitry/analytical/Coolidge.html">X-ray tube</a> in which core holes in the target are created by energetic electron bomardment, leading to themission of characteristic lines (such as K<sub>&alkpha;</i>). </p>
