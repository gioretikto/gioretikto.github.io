<h1>Mach's principle</h1>

<p>Newton required notions such as motion, velocity and acceleration: the natural question would be 'motion, velocity and acceleration'  with respect to what? and the natural answer would be with respect to absolute space. For Mach absolute space was a metaphysical and mental construct that could not be produced by expercience and its postulation was unnecesasry. For Mach, all motion was <i>relative</i>, experimental evidence was always <i>relative</i> positions and motions of objects.</p>

<p>Take a bucket of water, said Newton. Buckets usually come with a semi-circular handle. Bind a rope from the middle of its handle, and hang the rope from somewhere, with the bucket filled with water up to the middle. Now start rotating the bucket around the vertical axis that coincides with the rope, so that the rope becomes twisted, as in the figure. Then let go. What will happen to the surface of the water? In the first moments after you let the system loose the surface of the water will be flat. As the bucket picks up speed while spinning, its rotating wall will cause the water, reluctantly, to follow it into the rotating motion by friction. : When the water rotates somewhat fast, its surface will become concave. If you stop the bucket abruptly, water will continue rotating for awhile, its surface retaining the concave (parabolic, actually) shape, until finally it comes slowly to a rest, with its surface back to the flat state. That’s Newton’s bucket experiment. <br> Newton argued that the surface of the water becoming concave proves that the water is rotating. But with respect to what is it rotating? It can’t be rotating with respect to the bucket, because both the water and the bucket were spinning at around the same speed, thus they were stationary with respect to each other, yet the water had a concave surface. So we see that the shape of the surface cannot be predicted by the relative motion between bucket and water: just by looking at what the bucket does (spinning or not) you can’t tell what the surface of the water will look like. What if the bucket were the only thing in the universe? If the water is still rotating, said Newton, and an object's motion is alway relative to something else, it must be rotating with respect to absolute space. Thus Newton thought he brought up evidence for the existence of absolute space.</p>

<p>Newton gives no reason why the surface curves up when it is in rotation relative to absolute space. Mach, however, says that the cruvature stems from the fact that the water is in rotation <b>relative</b> to the fixed stars. A body in an empty universe cannot be said to be in motion according to Mach, since there is nothing to which the body's motion can be referred.</p>

<p>Mach's principle suggests that <i>the whole universe matters locally</i>. Inertia is the measure of the resistance of a body against any kind of accelartion with respect to absolute space, i.e. the distribution of mass in the Universe. Consequently the distribution of mass in the Universe effects inertia and no inertial effect would exist if "the rest of the universe" would not be present.</p>

<h2>Is Newtwon's Definition of Mass Circular</h2>

<p>An important example is Newton’s definition of ‘mass’ as the quantity of matter in a body. Once mass is defined, Newton could then regard his third law as expressing one of the ways in which it was manifested. Newton noted that mass was proportional to weight, but he was careful not to identity it with weight, because he knew that the weight of an objecct could change from place to place (experiments with pendulums had shown that gravity was weaker in some locations on Earth than in others).</p>

<p>From Mach’s point of view, though, Newton’s definition is, at best circular, defining mass through the concept of density, and density as mass per unit volume. At worst it is meaningless. <br>Mach chose to define mass through Newton’s third law; in an action-reaction pair, <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> /<i>m</i><sub>2</sub> is defined as being equal to <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> /<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, defined, that is, directly from measurable quantities.</p>

<p>In a valuable critical paper on the concept of mass, G. Burniston Brown has in some measure defenden Netwon as againts Mach. He suggest that when Newton spoke of density he meant what we now call <b>relative density</b>, and so Newtons's definition of mass is not circular after all. Newton thought he was defining "quantity of matter", the product</p>
