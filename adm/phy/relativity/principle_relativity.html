<h1>The principle of relativity</h1>

<p>Newtonian relativity (i.e., Galilean symmetry) says that the laws of physics are unchanged under the Galilean transformation (1.9). This implies that no mechanical experiment can detect any intrinsic difference between two inertial frames. It is easy to check that a physics equation, such as the one describing the Newtonian gravitational acceleration (<i><b>a</b></i> = – <i>GM<b>r̂</b></i>/<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> with <i>G</i> being Newton’s constant) of a test particle due to a point source with mass <i>M</i>, does not change its form under the Galilean transformation.</p>

<p>While Newtonian mechanics has Galilean symmetry, Maxwell’s equations are not covariant under the Galilean transformation. The most astounding result is that electromagnetic waves travel at the speed <i>c</i> = 1/√&mu;<sub>0</sub>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub> ≃ 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s. This is in complete contradiction with Galilean-Newtonian scheme of mechanics, in which the speed of a moving object must be referenced to the observer's frame of reference. Galilean-Newtonian mechanic would require the speed of light to diminish, or increase, depending on whether the observer is moving in the direction of the electromagnetic radiation, or away from it, according to Galilean velocity addition rule (1.10). This means that while Newtonian mechanics has Galilean symmetry, Maxwell’s equations are not covariant under the Galilean transformation.</p>

<h3>The ether theory</h3>

<p>For nineteenth-century physicists (including Maxwell himself), the most natural interpretation of light speed’s constancy was that the
Newtonian relativity principle should not apply. It was thought that, like all mechanical waves, electromagnetic waves must have an elastic medium, called ether, for their propagation. Maxwell’s equations were thought to be valid only in the rest frame of this ether medium. 5 The constant c was interpreted to be the speed of light waves relative to this ether—the frame of absolute rest.</p>

<h3>Einstein’s new kinematics</h3>

<p>Einstein proposed an explanation of light speed’s constancy: Maxwell’s equations do obey the principle of relativity, but the relationship between inertial frames is not correctly given by the Galilean transformation. Hence the velocity addition rule (1.10) is invalid; the correct velocity relation should be such that <i>c</i> can be the same in every inertial frame. The modification of the velocity addition rule is related to a new conception of a coordinate-dependent time, <i>t'</i> &ne; <i>t</i>. This turned out to be the correct interpretation. We shall discuss this in Section 1.2.</p>

<p>As nineteenth-century physicists generally believed in the existence of the ether and in the validity of Maxwell’s equations only in the rest frame of that ether, a key problem in physics was to understand motion in the ether frame. This was often referred to as “the electrodynamics of moving bodies.” The most developed dynamical ether theory was that of Hendrik Lorentz (1853–1928). In this 1890
theory, Lorentz introduced a mathematical construct (i.e., not a physical entity), called <i>local time</i>, to describe objects moving with respect to the ether:</p>

<p><i>t'</i> = <i>t</i> − <i>vx</i>/<i>c</i><sup>2</sup></p>

<p>However, the interferometry experiment by Albert Michelson (1852–1931) and E.W. Morley (1838–1923) showed that in different moving
frames the speed of light remained the same, even to an accuracy O(v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>).</p>
