<h1>Principle of Equivalence</h1>

<p>Enistein considered the followin thought experiment. Suppose, while you are inside an elevator, someone cuts the supporting cable. The elevator will be falling freely in the earth's gravitational field. But so will you, withe the same acceleration <i><b>g</b></i> of the elevator so that you weill be floating inside. Seen in another way, there will be in an intertial force −<i>m<b>g</b></i> acting on you, which, together with the gravitational foce <i><b>mg</b></i> of the earth will result in zero force on you. As a consequence, you will be weightless, just like an astronaut inside his space lab orbiting around the earth. <br>On the other hand, suppose you elevator is movev <i>upwards</i> with a constant acceleration <i><b>g</b></i>, (so that the acceleartion of the elevator is −<i><b>g</b></i>). Then you will feel twice as heavy, because now the induced inertial force will be <i>m<b>g</b>I which, along with the existing gravitational force <i>m<b>g</b></i>, will result in a total force of 2<i>m<b>g</b>.</p>

<p>A body in free fall experiences no gravitational field and behave like an inertial system. The equivalence principle states that in a freely falling referene frame the physics ins the same as that in an inertial frame with no gravity</p>
