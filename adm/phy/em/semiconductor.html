<h1>Semiconductors</h1>

<p>Elemental silicon has the same structure as diamond, as might be expected from its position in the periodic table (in Group 4A directly under carbon). Recall that in diamond there is a large energy gap between the filled and empty molecular orbitals (see Fig. 9‐23). This gap prevents excitation of electrons to the empty molecular orbitals (conduction bands) and makes diamond an insulator. In silicon the situation is similar, but the energy gap is smaller. A few electrons can cross the gap at 25°C, making silicon a <b>semiconducting element,</b> or <b>semiconductor</b>. In addition, at higher temperatures, where more energy is available to excite electrons into the conduction bands, the conductivity of silicon increases. This is typical behavior for a  and is in contrast to that of metals, whose conductivity decreases with increasing temperature.<br> The small conductivity of silicon can be enhanced at normal temperatures if the silicon crystal is doped with certain other elements. For example, when a small fraction of silicon atoms is replaced by phosphorus or arsenic atoms, each having <i>one more</i> valence electron than silicon, extra electrons become available for conduction. This produces an <b><i>n</i>-type semiconductor</b>, a substance whose conductivity is increased by doping it with atoms having more valence electrons than the atoms in the host crystal. <br> This extra electron does not participate
in any of the bonds to the four neighbors in the crystal, and is only weakly bound to the nucleus of the atom. It therefore takes very little energy to boost this extra electron out of its loosely bound state and into the conduction badn.</p>



<p>We also can enhance the conductivity of silicon by doping the crystal with an element such as boron, which has only three valence electrons, one less than silicon. Because boron has one less electron than is required to form the bonds with the surrounding silicon atoms, an electron vacancy, or <i>hole</i>, is created. As an electron fills this hole, it leaves a new hole, and this process can be repeated. Thus the hole advances through the crystal in a direction opposite to movement of the electrons jumping to fill the hole. Another way of thinking about this phenomenon is that in pure silicon each atom has four valence electrons and the low-energy molecular orbitals are exactly filled. Replacing silicon atoms with boron atoms leaves vacancies in these molecular orbitals, as shown in Fig. 9‐29(b). This means that there is only one electron in some of the molecular orbitals, and these unpaired electrons can function as conducting electrons. <br> Thus the substance becomes a better conductor. When semiconductors are doped with atoms having fewer valence electrons than the atoms of the host crystal, they are called <b>p-type semiconductors</b>, so named because the positive holes can be viewed as the charge carriers. <br> Most important applications of semiconductors involve connection of a p-type and an n-type to form a <b>p–n junction.</b> Figure 9‐30(a) shows a typical junction; the red dots represent excess electrons in the n-type semiconductor, and the white circles represent holes (electron vacancies) in the p-type semiconductor. At the junction, a small number of electrons migrate from the n-type region into the p-type region, where there are vacancies in the low-energy molecular orbitals. The effect of these migrations is to place a negative charge on the p-type region (since it now has a surplus of electrons) and a positive charge on the n-type region (since it has lost electrons, leaving holes in its low-energy molecular orbitals). This charge buildup, called the contact potential, or junction potential, prevents further migration of electrons. <br> Now suppose an external electric potential is applied by connecting the negative terminal of a battery to the p-type region and the positive terminal to the n-type region. The situation represented in Fig. 9‐30(b) results. Electrons are drawn toward the positive terminal, and the resulting holes move toward the negative terminal—exactly opposite to the natural flow of electrons at the p–n junction. The junction resists the imposed current flow in this direction and is said to be under reverse bias. No current flows through the system. <br> On the other hand, if the battery is connected so that the negative terminal is connected to the n-type region and the positive terminal is connected to the p-type region [Fig. 9‐30(c)], the movement of electrons (and holes) is in the favored direction. The junction has low resistance, and a current flows easily. The junction is said to be under <i>forward bias</i>. <br> A p–n junction makes an excellent rectifier, a device that produces a pulsating direct current (flows in one direction) from alternating current (flows in both directions
alternately). When placed in a circuit where the potential is constantly reversing, a p–n junction transmits current only under forward bias, thus converting the alternating current to direct current. Radios, computers, and other electronic devices formerly used bulky, unreliable vacuum tubes as rectifiers. The p–n junction has revolutionized electronics; modern solid-state components contain p–n junctions in printed circuits.</p>
