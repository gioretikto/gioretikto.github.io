<h1>Charging by Contact and by Induction</h1>

<p>When a negatively charged ebonite rod is rubbed on a metal object, such as the sphere in Figure 1, some of the excess electrons from the rod are transferred to the object. Once the electrons are on the metal sphere (where they can move readily) and the rod is removed, they repel one another and spread out over the sphere’s surface. The insulated stand prevents them from flowing to the earth, where they could spread out even more. As shown in part b of the picture, the sphere is left with a negative charge distributed over its surface. In a similar manner, the sphere would be left with a positive charge after being rubbed with a positively charged rod. In this case, electrons from the sphere would be transferred to the rod. The process of giving one object a net electric charge by placing it in contact with another object that is already charged is known as charging by contact.</p>

<p>It is also possible to charge a conductor in a way that does not involve contact. In Figure 2, a negatively charged rod is brought close to, but does not touch, a metal sphere. In the sphere, the free electrons closest to the rod move to the other side, as part a of the drawing indicates. As a result, the part of the sphere nearest the rod becomes positively charged and the part farthest away becomes negatively charged. These positively and negatively charged regions have been “induced” or “persuaded” to form because of the repulsive force between the negative rod and the free electrons in the sphere. If the rod were removed, the free electrons would return to their original places, and the charged regions would disappear. Under most conditions the earth is a good electrical conductor. So when a metal wire is
attached between the sphere and the ground, as in Animated Figure 2, some of the free electrons leave the sphere and distribute themselves over the much larger earth. If the grounding wire is then removed, followed by the ebonite rod, the sphere is left with a positive net charge, as part c of the picture shows. The process of giving one object a net electric charge without touching the object to a second charged object is called charging by induction. The process could also be used to give the sphere a negative net charge, if a positively charged rod were used. Then, electrons would be drawn up from the ground through the grounding wire and onto the sphere.</p>

(b) Some of the electrons leave the sphere through the grounding wire, with the result (c) that the sphere acquires a positive net charge.</figcaption>

<p>If the sphere in Figure 2 were made from an insulating material like plastic, instead of metal, the method of producing a net charge by induction would not work, because very little charge would fl ow through the insulating material and down the grounding wire. However, the electric force of the charged rod would have some eff ect on the insulating material. The electric force would cause the positive and negative charges in the molecules of the material to separate slightly, with the negative charges being “pushed” away from the negative rod, as Figure 3 illustrates. Although no net charge is created, the surface of the plastic does acquire a slight induced positive charge and is attracted to the negative rod. It is attracted in spite of the repulsive force between the negative rod and the negative charges in the plastic. This is because the negative charges in the plastic are further away from the rod than the positive charges are. For a similar reason, one piece of cloth can stick to another in the phenomenon known as “static cling,” which occurs when an article of clothing has acquired an electric charge while being tumbled about in a clothes dryer.</p>
