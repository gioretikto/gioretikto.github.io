<h1>Magnetic Domains</h1>

<p>The magnetic field produced by a current in a coil of wire gives us a hint as to what might cause certain materials to exhibit strong magnetic properties. A single coil like that in Figure 19.30a has a north pole and a south pole, but if that is true for a coil of wire, it should also be true for any current confined to a circular path. In particular, <i>an individual atom should act as a magnet because of the motion of the electrons about the nucleus</i>. Each electron, with its charge of 1.6 x 10<sup>−19</sup> C, circles the atom once in about 10<sup>−16</sup> s. If we divide the electric charge by this time interval, we see that the orbiting electron is equivalent to a current of 1.6 x 10<sup>23</sup> A. Such a current produces a magnetic field on the order of 20 T at the center of the circular path. From this we see that a very strong magnetic field would be produced if several of these atomic magnets could be aligned inside a material. This doesn’t occur, however, because the simple model we have described is not the complete story. A thorough analysis of atomic structure shows that the magnetic field produced by one electron in an atom is often canceled by an oppositely revolving electron in the same atom. <br>  A thorough analysis of atomic structure shows that the magnetic field produced by one electron in an atom is often canceled by an oppositely revolving electron in the same atom. The net result is that <b>the magnetic effect produced by the electrons orbiting the nucleus is either zero or very small for most materials</b>. <br> The magnetic properties of many materials can be explained by the fact that an electron not only circles in an orbit, but also spins on its axis like a top, with spin magnetic moment as shown (Fig. 19.37). (This classical description should not be taken too literally. The property of electron <i>spin</i> can be understood only in the context of quantum mechanics, which we will not discuss here.) The spinning electron represents a charge in motion that produces a magnetic field. The field due to the spinning is generally stronger than the field due to the orbital motion. In atoms containing many electrons, the electrons usually pair up with their spins opposite each other so that their fields cancel. That is why most substances are not magnets. In certain strongly magnetic materials, such as iron, cobalt, and nickel, however, the magnetic fields produced by the electron spins don’t cancel completely. Such materials are said to be <b>ferromagnetic</b>. In ferromagnetic materials strong coupling occurs between neighboring atoms, forming large groups of atoms with spins that are aligned. Called <b>domains</b>, the sizes of these groups typically range from about 10<sup>−4</sup> cm to 0.1 cm. In an unmagnetized substance, the domains are randomly oriented, as shown in Figure 2.a. When an external field is applied, as in Figures 2.b and 2.c, the magnetic field of each domain tends to come nearer to alignment with the external field, resulting in magnetization.<br> In what are called hard magnetic materials, domains remain aligned even after the external field is removed; the result is a <b>permanent magnet.</b> In soft magnetic materials, such as iron, once the external field is removed, thermal agitation produces motion of the domains and the material quickly returns to an unmagnetized state.</p>

<h2 id="electromagnets">Electromagnets</h2>

<p>An <i>electromagnet</i> is composed of a coil of wire wound around a core that is normally soft iron because of its high permeability and low hysteresis.</p>

<p>The alignment of domains explains why the strength of an electromagnet is increased dramatically by the insertion of an iron core into the magnet’s center. </p>

<figcaption><b>Fig 1.</b> The strength of an electromagnet changes depending on the material at the centre of the coil. If the iron is swapped for a steel rod, the electromagnetic field is less strong and it remains magnetised after the current is switched off. This is undesirable because one of the most important properties of an electromagnet is that it can be switched on and off as required.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The magnetic field produced by the current in the loops causes the domains to align, thus producing a large net external field. The use of iron as a core is also advantageous because it is a soft magnetic material that loses its magnetism almost
instantaneously after the current in the coils is turned off.<br> The formation of domains in ferromagnetic substances also explains why such substances are attracted to permanent magnets. The magnetic field of a permanent magnet realigns domains in a ferromagnetic object so that the object becomes temporarily magnetized. The object’s poles are then attracted to the corresponding opposite poles of the permanent magnet. The object can similarly attract other ferromagnetic objects, as illustrated in Figure 2.</p>

<p>In 1829, the American scientis, Joseph Henry, constructed the first electromagnet. It was an impressive device, capable of lifting tonne of iron. Henry had discovered that the magnetic force is greatly increased by coiling the wire around an iron core. This multiples the number of times that the elctric current passes in the same directions, providing the current cannot jump from one loop to the next, which increases the strenght of the magnetic field. Henry's work helped to bring about the invention of the electric motor and the dynamo (generato). Most of the electricity we use today is produced by large dynamos which use powerful electromagnets.</p>

<h3>How an electric doorbell works</h3>

<p>Electric doorbells are a good example of electromagnets.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>The doorbell is pressed which completes an electric circuit. An electric current flows around the circuit.</p></li>
	<li><p>The current flows through a wire wrapped around a soft iron core, which magnetises it to create an electromagnet.</p></li>
	<li><p>The electromagnet attracts an iron hammer, or armature which hits a bell.</p></li>
	<li><p>As the hammer hits the bell, it pulls the contacts apart, which breaks the circuit.</p></li>
	<li><p>With the circuit broken, the electric current stops flowing and the electromagnet loses its magnetism. The hammer moves back to its original position.</p></li>
	<li><p>This movement reconnects the circuit and the cycle begins all over agains. The bell is hit repeatedly while the doorbell is pressed.</p></li>
