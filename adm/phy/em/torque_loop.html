<h1>Torque on a Current loop</h1>

<p>At the end of the last section we considered the magnetic force on a straight current-carrying wire in a uniform magnetic field. Another important geometry of current flow, the <i>current loop</i>, is worthy of its own discussion. Consider the rectangular current loop lying in a region of uniform <i>B</i> field as shown if Fig.1. </p>

<figure>
<img src="img/current_loop.png" alt="current loop"/>
<figcaption><b>Fig.1</b>. A current-carrying rectangular loop oriented in a magnetic field is acted on by the magnetic force on each side. However only the forces on the sides parallel to the rotation axis produce a torque on the loop.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Suppose the loop is free to rotate about an axis passing through opposite sides. Because the loop is carrying current, the loop experiences a force in the magnetic field. Two sides of the loop are parallel to the axis of rotation, and two are perpendicular to it. The perpendicular wires don't play a part here because the force they experience is directed along the axis of rotation, so they don't produce any torque. Also, they're equal and opposite in size, so you don't get a net force from them. However the loop rotates because magnetic forces act on the vertical sides, labeled 1 and 2 in the drawing. These two forces have the same magnitude, but applying the right-hand rule, it results that they point in opposite directions, so the loop experiences no net force. Even though these forces, are also equal and opposite, they are not collinear. Hence they produce a net torque about the axis of the rectangular loop.</p>

<p>It is possible to determine the magnitude of the torque on the loop referring to Fig.2. From Eq. x the magnetic force on each vertical side has a magnitude of <i>F</i> = <i>ILB</i> sin 90°, where <i>L</i> is the length of side 1 or side 2, and <i>&theta;</i> = 90° because the current <i>I</i> always remains perpendicular to the magnetic field as the loop rotates. <br> The torque produced by a force is the product of the magnitude ofthe force and the lever arm: <i>&tau;</i> = <i><b>F</b></i> x <b>ℓ</b>.</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/torque_loop.png" alt="torque loop"/>
<figcaption><b>Fig. 2</b>. Assume B makes an angle of &theta; with the normal of the plane. The net torque about point <i>O</i> will be <i>&tau;</i> = IAB sin &theta;.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In fig. 2 the lever arm ℓ is the perpendicular distance from the line of actions of the force to the shaft. This distance is given by ℓ = (<i>w</i>/2) sin <i>&theta;</i>, where <i>w</i> is the width of the loop, and &theta; is the angle between the normal to the plane of the loop and the direction of the magnetic field. The net torque is the sum of the torques on the two sides, so</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Net torque = <i>&tau;</i> = <i>ILB</i> (<i>w</i>/2 sin &theta;) + <i>ILB</i> (<i>w</i>/2 sin &theta;) = <i>IAB</i> sin &theta;</p>
</div>

<p>In this result the product <i>Lw</i> has been replaced by the area <i>A</i> of the loop. If the wire is wrapped so as to form a coil containing <i>N</i> loops, each of area <i>A</i>, the force on each side is <i>N</i> times large, and the torque becomes proportionally greater:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&tau;</i> = <i>NIA</i> (<i>B</i> sin &theta;)</p>
</div>

<p>We can conclude that</p>

<blockquote>When a current-carrying loop is placed in a magnetic field, the loop tends to rotate such that its normal becomes aligned with the magnetic field.</blockquote>

<p>This equation has been derived for a rectangular coil, but it is valid for any shape of flat coil, such as a circular coil. The torque depends on the geometric properties of the coil, and the current in it through the quantity <i>NIA</i>. This quantity is known as the <b>magnetic moment</b> of the coil, and its uit is ampere ⋅ meter<sup>2</sup> (A ⋅ m<sup>2</sup>). The greater the magnetic momnet of a current-carrying coil, the greater is the torque that the coil experiences when placed in a magnetic field.</p>

<p>It is convenient to introduce the <i>magnetic dipole moment</i>, of a coil; a vecor quantity whose magnitude is <i>&mu;</i> = <i>NIA<b>n</b></i>. The direction of <b>&mu;</b> (<b>n</b>) is determined by circling the fingers of the right hand in the direction of the (conventional) current in the coil. The thumb then points in the direction of <b><i>&mu;</i></b>. Thus <b><i>&mu;</i></b> is always perpendicular to the plane of the coil.</p>

<p>The magnetic torque, can hence be written as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i><b>&tau;</b> = <b>&mu;</b> x <b>B</b></i></p>
</div>

<p>From which we can understand that the magnetic torque tends to aling the magnetic moment vector (<b>&mu;</b>) with the magnetic field direction: a loop or coil is subject to a torque until sin &theta; = 0, i.e., &theta; = 0°, at which point the forces producing the torque are parallel to the plane of the loop. This situation exists when the plane of the loop is perpendicular to the field. Thus if the loop is started from rest with its magnetic moment at some angle with the field, it will experience an angular acceleration that will tend to rotate it toward the zero angle position: that is, when the magnetic moment is in the direction of the field.<br> Rotational inertia will the carry it through this equilibrium position (zero angle) and on to the other side. On that side, the torque will then slow the loop, eventually stopping it, and then act to reaccelerate it back toward equilibrium. In other words, the torque on the loop is <i>restoring</i> and tends to cause the magnetic momento to oscillate about the field direction, much like a compass needle as it settles down (due to frinction on its pivot) to eventually point north.</p>
