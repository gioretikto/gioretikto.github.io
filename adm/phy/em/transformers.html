<h1>Transformers</h1>

<p>One of the main reasons that we use alternating AC voltages and currents in our homes and workplace’s is that AC supplies can be easily generated at a convenient voltage, transformed (hence the name transformer) into much higher voltages and then distributed around the country using a national grid of pylons and cables over very long distances.</p>

<p>The reason for transforming the voltage to a much higher level is that higher distribution voltages implies lower currents for the same power and therefore lower <i>I</i><sup>2</sup><i>R</i> losses along the networked grid of cables. These higher AC transmission voltages and currents can then be reduced to a much lower, safer and usable voltage level where it can be used to supply electrical equipment in our omes and workplaces, and all this is possible thanks to the basic <b>Voltage Transformer</b>. <br> A transformer consists of an iron core that connects two coils (primary and secondary coil). If an alternating voltage is applies to the primary coil, this causes an alternating current, which is turn causes a changing magnetic field in both coils. <br> Depending on the numbers of turns in the respective coils, the magnetic field induces a secondary voltage in the secondary coil, which is increased or reduced relative to the primary voltage.</p>

<figcaption>An AC voltage &Delta;V<sub>1</sub> is applied to the primary coil, and the output voltage &Delta;V<sub>2</sub> is observed across the load resistance <i>R</i>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In its simplest form, the AC transformer consists of two coils of wire wound around a core of soft iron, as shown in Figure 21.15. The coil on the left, which is connected to the input AC voltage source and has <i>N</i><sub>1</sub> turns, is called the <i>primary</i> winding, or the primary. The coil on the right, which is connected to a resistor <i>R</i> and consists of <i>N</i><sub>2</sub> turns, is the secondary. The common iron core is used to increase the magnetic flux and to provide a medium in which nearly all the flux through one coil passes through the other. When an input AC voltage &Delta;<i>V</i><sub>1</sub> is applied to the primary, the induced voltage across it is given by</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&Delta;<i>V</i><sub>1</sub> = − <i>N</i><sub>1</sub> &Delta;&Phi; / &Delta;<i>t</i></p>
</div>

<p>where <i>&Phi;<sub>B</sub></i> is the magnetic flux through each turn. If we assume that no flux leaks from the iron core, then the flux through each turn of the primary equals the flux through each turn of the secondary. Hence, the voltage across the secondary coil is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&Delta;<i>V</i><sub>2</sub> = − <i>N</i><sub>2</sub> &Delta;&Phi; / &Delta;<i>t</i></p>
</div>

<p>The term &delta;<i>&Phi;<sub>B</sub></i> / &Delta;<i>t</i> is common to Equations 21.20 and 21.21 and can be algebraically eliminated, giving</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&Delta;<i>V</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>N</i><sub>2</sub> &Delta;<i>V</i><sub>1</sub>/ <i>N</i><sub>1</sub></p>
</div>

<p>By Faraday’s law, a voltage is generated across the secondary only when there is a change in the number of flux lines passing through the secondary (<b>mutua induzione</b>). The input current in the primary must therefore change with time, which is what happens when an alternating current is used. When the input at the primary is a direct current, however, a voltage output occurs at the secondary only at the instant a switch in the primary circuit is opened or closed. Once the current in the primary reaches a steady value, the output voltage at the secondary is zero.</p>

<p>It may seem that a transformer is a device in which it is possible to get something for nothing. For example, a step - up transformer can change an input voltage from, say, 10 V to 100 V. This means that each coulomb of charge leaving the secondary has 100 J of energy, whereas each coulomb of charge entering the primary has only 10 J of energy. That is not the case, however, because the power input to the primary equals the power output at the secondary:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>I</i><sub>1</sub> &Delta;<i>V</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>I</i><sub>2</sub> &Delta;<i>V</i><sub>2</sub> &emsp; 21.2</p>
</div>

<p>Although the <i>voltage</i> at the secondary may be, say, ten times greater than the voltage at the primary, the <i>current</i> in the secondary will be smaller than the primary’s current by a factor of ten. Equation 21.2 assumes an <b>ideal transformer</b> in which there are no power losses between the primary and the secondary. Real transformers typically have power efficiencies ranging from 90% to 99%. Power losses occur because of such factors as eddy currents induced in the iron core of the transformer, which dissipate energy in the form of <i>I</i><sup>2</sup><i>R</i> losses. <br> When electric power is transmitted over large distances, it’s economical to use a high voltage and a low current because the power lost via resistive heating in the transmission lines varies as <i>I</i><sup>2</sup><i>R</i>. If a utility company can reduce the current by a factor of ten, for example, the power loss is reduced by a factor of one hundred. In practice, the voltage is stepped up to around 230 000 V at the generating station, then stepped down to around 20 000 V at a distribution station, and finally stepped down to 120 V at the customer’s utility pole.</p>

<h2>Raffreddamento</h2>

<p>Il trasformatore dissipa potenza sia nel nucleo ferromagnetico, a causa dell'isteresi e delle correnti parassite, che negli avvolgimenti, per effetto joule; per evitare che gli isolamenti vengano danneggiati, dall'eccessiva temperatura, il calore prodotto deve essere smaltito; a tal fine gli avvolgimentis (e per grossi trasformatori anche entro il nucleo) sono presenti opportunti canali per il passaggio di un fluido refrigerante. I trasformatori di piccola e media potenza hanno in genere isolamento solido impregnato in resina e sono refrigerati ad aria in ventilazione naturale o forzata. I trasformatori di grande potenza di solito sono isolati in olio (che presenta al tempo stesso ottieme proprietà termiche e dielettriche) e il calore viene smaltito all'esterno attraverso le pareti del casso, grazie adl alette, tubi o scambiatori di calore esterni, a loro volta raffreddati a convezione forzata, ad aria od acqua.</p>
