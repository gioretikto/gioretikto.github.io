<h1>Alternating current</h1>

<p>Most of the current generated by electric utilities worldwide is not DC, but alternating current, or AC.</p>

<p>An AC circuit consists of combinations of circuit elements and an AC generator or an AC source, which provides the alternating current. We have seen that the output of an AC generator is sinusoidal and varies with time according to</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>V</i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>V</i><sub>0</sub>sin 2&pi;<i>ft</i></p>
</div>

<p>where <i>V</i><sub>0</sub> is the maximum voltage, <i>f</i> is the frequency which the voltage cycles (60 Hz for wall current in the United States), and <i>t</i> is time. We consider a circuit composed by a resitor and ask ourselves, what's the current that flows as a result of the voltage when the switch is closed? The resistor doesn't react to changing voltage (as capacitors and inductors do); the collisions between electrons and the fixed atoms of the resistor result in an increase in the resistor’s temperature regardless of the direction of the current. For a resistor <i>V</i> = <i>IR</i>, no matter how the voltage is chaning, so the current is the circuit it</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>I</i>(<i>t</i>) = (<i>V</i><sub>0</sub>/<i>R</i>) sin 2&pi;<i>ft</i></p>
</div>

<figcaption>The instantaneuous voltage <i>V</i> and current <i>I</i> in a purely resistive circuit are <i>in phase</i>, which means that they increase and decrease in step with one another.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>What about power dissipated in a circuit (power dissipatd by the resistor as heat)? We can quantify this discussion by recalling that the rate at which electrical energy is dissipated in a resistor, the power <i>P</i>, is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>P</i> = <i>I</i><sup>2</sup><i>R</i>
</div>

<p>where i is the <i>instantaneous</i> current in the resistor. Because the heating effect of a current is proportional to the <i>square</i> of the current, it makes no difference whether the sign associated with the current is positive or negative. The heating effect produced by an alternating current with a maximum value of <i>I</i><sub>0</sub> is not the same as that produced by a direct current of the same value, however. The reason is that the alternating current has this maximum value for only an instant of time during a cycle. The important quantity in an AC circuit is a special kind of average value of current, called the <b>rms current</b>. Finding the average of the alternating current <i>I</i>, depicted in Figure 21.3a (page 690), would not be useful because that average is zero, whereas the rms current is always positive. To find the rms current, we first square the current, then find its average value, and finally take the square root of this average value. Hence, the rms current is the square root of the average (mean) of the square of the current.</p>

<p>We can show that (I<sup>2</sup>)<sub>av</sub> = I<sup>2</sup><sub>max</sub> /2 as follows: The current in the circuit varies with time according to the expression I = I<sub>0</sub> sin 2&pi;<i>ft</i>, so <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>I</i><sup>2</sup><sub>0</sub> sin<sup>2</sup> 2&pi;<i>ft</i>. Therefore, we can find the average value of <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> by calculating the average value of sin<sup>2</sup> 2&pi;<i>ft</i>. Note that a graph of cos<sup>2</sup> 2&pi;<i>ft</i> versus time is identical to a graph of sin<sup>2</sup> 2&pi;<i>ft</i> versus time, except that the points are shifted on the time axis. Thus, the time average of sin<sup>2</sup> 2pi;<i>ft</i> is equal to the time average of cos 2 2&pi;<i>ft</i>, taken over one or more cycles. That is,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>(sin<sup>2</sup> 2&pi;<i>ft</i>)<sub>av</sub> = (cos<sup>2</sup> 2&pi;<i>ft</i>)<sub>av</sub></p>
</div>

<p>With this fact and the trigonometric identity sin<sup>2</sup> &theta; + cos<sup>2</sup> &theta; = 1, we get</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>(sin<sup>2</sup> 2&pi;<i>ft</i>)<sub>av</sub> + (cos<sup>2</sup>2&pi;<i>ft</i>)<sub>av</sub> = 2(sin<sup>2</sup> 2&pi;<i>ft</i>)<sub>av</sub> = 1<br>
(sin<sup>2</sup> 2&pi;<i>ft</i>)<sub>av</sub> = 1/2</p>
</div>

<p>When this result is substituted into the expression <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = I<sup>2</sup><sub>0</sub> sin<sup>2</sup> 2&pi;<i>ft</i>, we get (I<sup>2</sup>)<sub>av</sub> = I<sup>2</sup><sub>rms</sub> = I<sup>2</sup><sub>0</sub>/√2, or I<sub>rms</sub> = I<sub>0</sub> /2, where <i>I</i><sub>rms</sub> is the rms current. Therefore, the rms current <i>I</i><sub>rms</sub> is related to the maximum value of the alternating current <i>I</i><sub>0</sub> by</p>

<!-- $$ I_{\text{rms}} = \frac{I_0}{\sqrt{2}} = 0.707 I_0$$ -->

<p>The <b>rms</b> current can be seen as the direct current that dissipates the same amount of energy in a resistor as the actual alternating current: an alternating current with a maximum value of 3 A produces the same heating effect in a resistor as a direct current of (3/√2) A. We can therefore say that the average power dissipated in a resistor that carries alternating current <i>I</i> is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>P</i><sub>av</sub> = <i>I</i><sup>2</sup><sub>rms</sub><i>R</i></p>
</div>

<p>Alternating voltages are also best discussed in terms of rms voltages, with a relationship identical to the preceding one,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>V</i> = <i>V</i><sub>0</sub>/√2 = 0.707 <i>V</i><sub>0</sub></p>
</div>

<p>When we speak of measuring an AC voltage of 120 V from an electric outlet, we actually mean an rms voltage of 120 V. A quick calculation using Equation 21.3 shows that such an AC voltage actually has a peak value of about 170 V. In this topic, we use rms values when discussing alternating currents and voltages. One reason is that AC ammeters and voltmeters are designed to read rms values.
Further, if we use rms values, many of the equations for alternating current will have the same form as those used in the study of direct-current (DC) circuits.</p>
