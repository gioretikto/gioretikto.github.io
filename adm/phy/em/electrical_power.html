<h1>Electrical Energy and Power</h1>

<p>If a battery is used to establish an electric current in a conductor, chemical energy stored in the battery is continuously transformed into kinetic energy of the charge carriers. This kinetic energy is quickly lost as a result of collisions between the
charge carriers and fixed atoms in the conductor, causing an increase in the temperature of the conductor. In this way, the chemical energy stored in the battery is continuously transformed into thermal energy.

To understand the process of energy transfer in a simple circuit, consider a battery with terminals connected to a resistor (Fig. 17.11; remember that the positive terminal of the battery is always at the higher potential). Now imagine following a quantity of positive charge &Delta;Q around the circuit from point A, through the battery and resistor, and back to A. Point A is a reference point that
is grounded (the ground symbol is ), and its potential is taken to be zero. As the charge &Delta;Q moves from A to B through the battery, the electrical potential energy of the system increases by the amount DQ DV and the chemical potential energy in the battery decreases by the same amount. (Recall from Topic 16 that &Delta;PE = q &Delta;V) As the charge moves from C to D through the resistor, however, it
loses this electrical potential energy during collisions with atoms in the resistor. In the process, the energy is transformed to internal energy corresponding to increased vibrational motion of those atoms. Because we can ignore the very small resistance of the interconnecting wires, no energy transformation occurs for paths BC and DA. When the charge returns to point A, the net result is that
some of the chemical energy in the battery has been delivered to the resistor and has caused its temperature to rise.</p>

<p>The charge &Delta;Q loses energy &Delta;Q &Delta;V as it passes through the resistor. If &Delta;t is the time it takes the charge to pass through the resistor, the instantaneous rate at which it loses electric potential energy is</p>

<!-- $$\lim_{\Delta t\to 0} \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} \Delta V = I \Delta V $$ -->

<p>where <i>I</i> is the current in the resistor and &Delta;V is the potential difference across it. Of course, the charge regains this energy when it passes through the battery, at the expense of chemical energy in the battery. The rate at which the system loses potential energy as the charge passes through the resistor is equal to the rate at which the system gains internal energy in the resistor. Therefore, the power <i>P</i>, representing the rate at which energy is delivered to the resistor, is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>P</i> = <i>I</i>&Delta;<i>V</i></p>
</div>

<p>Using Equation Ohm's law, we can express the power delivered to the resistor in the alternate forms</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>P</i> = <i>I</i><sup>2</sup><i>R</i> = &Delta;<i>V</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>R</i></p>

<p>Regardless of the ways in which you use electrical energy in your home, you ultimately must pay for it or risk having your power turned off. The unit of energy used by electric companies to calculate consumption, the <b>kilowatt-hour</b>, is defined in terms of the unit of power and the amount of time itâ€™s supplied. One kilowatt-hour (kWh) is the energy converted or consumed in 1 h at the constant rate of 1 kW. It has the numerical value</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>1 kW h = (10<sup>3</sup> W)(3 600 s) = 3.60 x 10<sup>6</sup> J</p>
</div>

<p>On an electric bill, the amount of electricity used in a given period is usually stated in multiples of kilowatt-hours.</p>
