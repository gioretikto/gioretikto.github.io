<h1>Magnets</h1>

<p>Most people have had experience with some form of magnet. You are most likely familiar with the common iron horseshoe magnet that can pick up iron-containing objects such as paper clips and nails. In the discussion that follows, we assume the magnet has the shape of a bar. Iron objects are most strongly attracted to either end of such a bar magnet, called its <b>poles</b>. One end is called the <b>north pole</b> and the other the <b>south pole</b>. The names come from the behavior of a magnet in the presence of Earth’s magnetic field. If a bar magnet is suspended from its midpoint by a piece of string so that it can swing freely in a horizontal plane, it will rotate until
its north pole points to the north and its south pole points to the south. The same idea is used to construct a simple compass. Magnetic poles also exert attractive or repulsive forces on each other similar to the electrical forces between charged objects. In fact, simple experiments with two bar magnets show that <b>like poles repel each other and unlike poles attract each other</b>. <br> Although the force between opposite magnetic poles is similar to the force between positive and negative electric charges, there is an important difference: positive and negative electric charges can exist in isolation of each other, whereas north and south magnetic poles do not. No matter how many times a permanent magnet is cut, each piece always has a north pole and a south pole. There is some theoretical basis, however, for the speculation that magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles) exist in nature, and the attempt to detect them is currently an active experimental field of investigation.<br> An unmagnetized piece of iron can be magnetized by stroking it with a magnet. Magnetism can also be induced in iron (and other materials) by other means. For example, if a piece of unmagnetized iron is placed near a strong permanent magnet, the piece of iron eventually becomes magnetized. The process can be accelerated by heating and then cooling the iron.<br> Naturally occurring magnetic materials such as magnetite are magnetized in this way because they have been subjected to Earth’s magnetic field for long periods of time. The extent to which a piece of material retains its magnetism depends on whether it is classified as magnetically hard or soft. <b>Soft</b> magnetic materials, such as iron, are easily magnetized but tend to lose their magnetization easily. These materials are used in the cores of transformers, generators, and motors. Iron is the most
common choice because it’s inexpensive. Other magnetically soft materials include nickel, nickel-iron alloys, and ferrites. Ferrites are combinations of a divalent metal oxide of nickel or magnesium with ferric oxide. Ferrites are used in high - frequency applications, such as radar.<br> <b>Hard</b> magnetic materials are used in permanent magnets. Such magnets provide magnetic fields without the use of electricity. Permanent magnets are used in many devices, including loudspeakers, permanent - magnet motors, and the read/write heads of computer hard drives. There are a large number of different materials used in permanent magnets. Alnico is a generic name for various alloys of iron, cobalt, and nickel, together with smaller amounts of aluminum, copper, or other elements. Rare earths such as samarium and neodymium are also used in conjunction with other elements to make strong permanent magnets.<br> In earlier topics, we described the interaction between charged objects in terms of electric fields. Recall that an electric field surrounds any stationary electric charge. The region of space surrounding a <i>moving</i> charge includes a magnetic field as well. A magnetic field also surrounds a properly magnetized magnetic material. <br> To describe any type of vector field, we must define its magnitude, or strength, and its direction. The direction of a magnetic field <b><i>B</i></b> at any location is the direction in which the north pole of a compass needle points at that location. Figure 19.2a shows how the magnetic field of a bar magnet can be traced with the aid of a compass, defining a <b>magnetic field line</b>. Several magnetic field lines of a bar magnet traced out in this way appear in the two-dimensional representation in Figure 19.2b. Magnetic field patterns can be displayed by placing small iron filings in the vicinity of a magnet, as in Figure 19.3.<br> Forensic scientists use a technique similar to that shown in Figure 19.3 (page 622) to find fingerprints at a crime scene. One way to find latent, or invisible, prints is by sprinkling a powder of iron dust on a surface. The iron adheres to any perspiration or body oils that are present and can be spread around on the surface with a magnetic brush that never comes into contact with the powder or the surface.</p>
