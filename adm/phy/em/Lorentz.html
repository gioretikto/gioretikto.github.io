<h1>Magnetic force (or Lorentz Force)</h1>

<p>Experiments show that a stationary charged particle doesn’t interact with a static magnetic field. <b>When a charged particle is <i>moving</i> through a magnetic field, however, a magnetic force acts on it</b>. This force has its maximum value when the charge moves in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic field lines, decreases in value at other angles, and becomes zero when the particle moves along the field lines. This is quite different from the electric force, which exerts a force on a charged particle whether it’s moving or at rest. Further, the electric force is directed parallel to the electric field whereas the magnetic force on a moving charge is directed perpendicular to the magnetic field.<br> In our discussion of electricity, the electric field at some point in space was defined as the electric force per unit charge acting on some test charge placed at that point. In a similar way, we can describe the properties of the magnetic field <b><i>B</i></b> at some point in terms of the magnetic force exerted on a test charge at that point. Our test object is a charge <i>q</i> moving with velocity <b><i>v</i></b>. It is found experimentally that the strength of the magnetic force on the particle is proportional to the magnitude of the charge <i>q</i>, the magnitude of the velocity <b><i>v</i></b>, the strength of the external magnetic field <b><i>B</i></b>, and the sine of the angle <i>&theta;</i> between the direction of <b><i>v</i></b> and the direction of <b><i>B</i></b>. These observations can be summarized by writing the magnitude of the magnetic force as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i><b>F</b></i> = <i>q<b>v</b></i> x <i><b>B</b></i> &emsp;4.1.1</p>
</div>

<p><b><i>B</i></b> is called the <b>magnetic induction</b> or the <b>magnetic field</b> which then can be defines as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>B</i> ≡ <i>F</i>/(<i>qvsin&theta;</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>If <i>F</i> is in newtons, <i>q</i> in coulombs, and <i>v</i> in meters per second, the SI unit of magnetic field is the <b>tesla</b> (T), also called the weber (Wb) per square meter (1 T = 1 Wb/m<sup>2</sup>). If a 1-C charge moves in a direction perpendicular to a magnetic field of magnitude 1 T with a speed of 1 S m/s, the magnetic force exerted on the charge is 1 N. We can express the units of <i><b>B</b></i> as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>[B] = T = Wb/m<sup>2</sup> = N / (C ⋅ m/s) = N / (A ⋅ m)</p>
</div>

<p>In practice, the cgs unit for magnetic field, the gauss (G), is often used. The gauss is related to the tesla through the conversion</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>1 T = 10<sup>4</sup> G</p>
</div>

<p>Conventional laboratory magnets can produce magnetic fields as large as about 25 000 G, or 2.5 T. Superconducting magnets that can generate magnetic fields as great as 3 x 10<sup>5</sup> G, or 30 T, have been constructed. These values can be compared with the small value of Earth’s magnetic field near its surface, which is only about 0.5 G, or 0.5 x 10<sup>24</sup> T. <br> From Equation 4.1.1, we see that the force on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field has its maximum value when the particle’s motion is perpendicular to the magnetic field, corresponding to <i>&theta;</i> = 90°, so that sin <i>&theta;</i> = 1. The magnitude of this maximum force has the value</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>F<sub>max</sub></i> = <i>qvB</i></p>
</div>

<p>Also from Equation 4.1.1, <b><i>F</i></b> is zero when <b><i>v</i></b> is parallel to <b><i>B</i></b> (corresponding to <i>&theta;</i> = 0° or 180°), so no magnetic force is exerted on a charged particle when it moves in the direction of the magnetic field or opposite the field. <br>Experiments show that the direction of the magnetic force is always perpendicular to both <b><i>v</i></b> and <b><i>B</i></b> as shown in Figure 1</p>

<p>For a positively charged particle. To determine the direction of the force, we employ right-hand rule number 1:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Point the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the velocity <b><i>v</i></b>.</p></li>
	<li><p>Curl the fingers in the direction of the magnetic field <b><i>B</i></b>, moving through the smallest angle (as in Fig. 19.7).</p></li>
	<li><p>Your thumb is now pointing in the direction of the magnetic force <b><i>F</i></b> exerted on a positive charge.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If the charge is negative rather than positive, the force <b><i>F</i></b> is directed <i>opposite</i> to the force acting on the positive charge.</p>
