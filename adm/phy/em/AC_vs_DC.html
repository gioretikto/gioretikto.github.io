<h1>AC vs DC</h1>

<p>If electricity is transported in cables, a certain amount of electrical energy is always lost as waste heat. According to Joule's law, <i>P</i> = <i>I</i><sup>2</sup><i>R</i>, this heat is proportional to the <i>square</i> of the current. Doubling the current therefore leads to a four-fold heat loss. At the same times, the electrical power that is to be transported is proportional to the product of current and voltage, <i>P</i> = <i>IV</i>. This means that if you want to lower the current to reduce heat loss, but at the same time still transport large amounts of electrical energy, the voltage must be very high. This applies equally to AC and DC.</p>

<blockquote>Only the transport of electricity under high voltage keeps heat loss low and enables the trasmission of large amounts of energy.</blockquote>

<p>In the late 19th century, for the first time in the history of industry, the USA expercienced a bitter debate about a techinal standard. Thomas Edison, with his company General Electric, relied on DC and maintained widely ramified DC power networks throughout the country. His competitor George Westinghouse with his company Westinghouse Electric, on the other hand, wanted to expand his alternating current networks throughout the country. It was about time that consumers should no longer have to decide which type of electricity they preferred when buying motors, light bulbs, and the like. The questions was: should the US be supplied with DC or AC?<br> When it comes to trasporting electricity, DC is clearly superior to AC at the same voltages and current strengths (and thus power):</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>DC can be transported very efficiently over several thousands kilometers. With AC, on the other hand, in addition to the Ohmic resistance of the transport wire, two futher forms of resistance occur due to the permanent switching back and forth: inductive and capacitive reactance. They lead so-called reactive currents and, at distances of more than a few hundred kilometers, cause the energy losses of AC transmission to become quite large.</p></li>

	<li><p>While direct current flows through the entire conductor cross-section, the so-called skin effect means that with AC only the outer zones of the conductor cross-sectin are used for current transport.</p></li>

	<li><p>DC even makes underground routes possible. If, on the other hand, wires for AC are laid in the ground, the energy losses due to reactive currents are particularly high and the transport of electricity due to reactive currents are particularly high and trasport of electricity becomes uneconomical from just a few dozen kilometres of line length.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>At the same voltage and current, the transport losses of DC are therefore much lower than those of AC. Nevertheless, AC still made the running.</p>

<p>Since the early twenty-first century, DC has been gaining in importance agai.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><b>In electricity production</b>: Solar cells, biomass plants, and other DC producing renewable energies are oon the advance (wind turbines and water turbines, however, supply AC − just like everything that "goes round and round").</p></li>

	<li><p><b>In electricity storage</b>: Increasingly important storage media suach as batteries and chemical storage devices operate with DC.</p></li>

	<li><p></b>In terms of electricity consumption</b>: Most modern electrical appliances, from LED lamps to computers and electric cars, use DC. They must all rectify alternating current wit a special power supply unit. The fact that an extra portion of energy is lost in the process is shown by the fact the power supply units get hot.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>DC power transmission is more efficient than AC and is used for many long distance lines. It can also conveniently provide a connection between asynchronous AC systems. <br> AC is used (especially historically) because of the ease with which voltages and currents can be transformed. AC is transformed up to 60.000 - 1.000.000 V at the starting point of high-voltage lines, and then down to the usual 220 V at the destination. <br> However DC transformers have also been available for some years now. These power converters no longer work with induction and large coils, which was the state of theart since the nineteenth century. Thanks to modern semiconductor electronics they are now small, light and low loss. They make high-voltage DC (HVDC) trasmission possible. </p>
