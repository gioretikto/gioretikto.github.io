<h1>Conservation of angular momentum</h1>

<p></p>


<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Motocross</h3>

<p>Motorcycle daredevils who make large jumps must shift their body weight forwards as they leave the ramp in order to keep the bike from flipping over backwards.  When the bike leaves the ramp, the wheels (without the resistance of the ramp) immediately start spinning faster in a forward direction.  Conservation of angular momentum then dictates that the system of the bike must rotate backwards.  Shifting the rider's weight to the front of the bike changes the location of the center of mass of the bike/rider unit to a  more forward location on the motorcycle. Since the center of mass follows the parabolic path, the new center of mass causes the motorcycle to rotate forward, thus lowering the front wheel.</p>

<p>By locking the rear brakes, the rider may stop rotation of the rear wheel. The resulting change in the motorcycle'S orientation is  explained by conservation of angular momentum. Before the rider locks the rear brakes, the rear wheel spinning around the rear axle exhibits angular momentum, as does the entire motorcycle. Once the rear wheel is locked, the angular momentum originally in the rear wheel must be transferred to another part of the motorcycle in order for angular momentum of the entire motorcycle to be conserved. Thus, the frame of the motorcycle rotates downward, bringing the front wheel down. These two methods are used by racers to resolve front wheel loft and often prevent disastrous crashes. </p>
