<h1>Faraday's Law</h1>

<p>In 1819 Hans Christian Oersted dIscovered that an electric current exerted a force on a magnetic compass. Although there had long been speculation that such a relationship existed, Oersted’s finding was the first evidence of a link between electricity and magnetism. Because nature is often symmetric, the discovery that electric currents produce magnetic fields led scientists to suspect that magnetic fields could produce electric currents. Indeed, experiments conducted by Michael Faraday in England and independently by Joseph Henry in the United States in 1831 showed that a changing magnetic field could induce an electric current in a circuit. The results of these experiments led to a basic and important law known as <b>Faraday’s law</b>. In this topic, we discuss Faraday’s law and several practical applications, one of which is the production of electrical energy in power plants throughout the world.</p>

<p>Dall'esame quantitativo dei casi esaminati e di altre situazioni analoghe riconducibili a quelle descritte, Faraday dedusse la legge nota come <b>legge di Faraday</b> (o </p>

<p><i>Faraday's law</i> (aka faraday-Neumann or Faraday-Henry) states that a time-varying <i>magnetic flux</i> &Phi;(<b><i>B</i></b>), through a surface <i>S</i> bounded by a curve <i>C</i> generates an electric field with an integrated value around <i>C</i> termed the <b>induced emf</b> (electromotive force), <i>ℰ<sub>i</sub></i>, given by</p>

<p>where <b><i>E<sub>i</sub></sup></i></b> represents the <b>induced electric field</b>. Since the circutation is different from zero, such a field is not conservative.</p>

<h2 id="Lenz">Lenz's Law: Finding the direction of the Induced Current</h2>

<p>The minus sign in Equation 6.1.1 is included to indicate the polarity of the induced emf, <i>ℰ<sub>i</sub></i>. This polarity determines the direction of the current in the loop and is given by Lenz’s law:</p>

<blockquote>The current caused by the induced emf travels in the direction that creates a magnetic field with flux opposing the change in the original flux through the circuit.</blockquote>

<p>Consider the following figure, in which a magnet is moving towards the loop:</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/Lenz.png" alt="Lenze's law"/>
<figcaption><b>Fig.2</b>. a) As the magnet moves to the right, positive flux increases through the coil. b) The induced current produces negative flux, countering the increasing positive flux.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>if the sole effect would be to generate a current in the loop, by the the induced emf, <i>ℰ<sub>i</sub></i>, energy would be created out of nothing. Instead the induced emf creates a current and associated magnetic field that produces negative magnetic flux, opposing the flux of the magnet and slowing the magnet down. The implication of Lenz's law in this example is that an external force must be applied to the magnet to keep it moving. Work must be done. This is necessary for <b>energy conservation</b>, since the induced current can itself expend energy or do work. If not work were required to induce the current, the would be energy output with no energy input.</p>

<h2 id="inductance">Self-inductance</h2>

<p>We've seens that any change in the magnetic flux passing through a loop results in an induced emd. <b>Self-inductance</b> is a particular case of this phenomenon: a change in the current in a conducting loop generates an induced emd in that loop.</p>

<p>A current <i>i</i> flowing through a conductor generates a magnetic field by the Ampère–Laplace law. The magnetic flux linked with the circuit is directly proportional to the current <i>I</i> passign through it</p>

<figcaption>After the switch in the circuit is closed, the current produces its own magnetic flux through the loop. An opposing emf is therefore induced, meaning the current relatively slowly increases toward its maximum value rather than jumping to that value right away. The battery with the dashed lines is a symbol for the self-induced emf.</figcaption>

<p>Where &Sigma; is the whole surface spanning the current path. Since the magnetic field <b><i>B</i></b> of the current in the circuit is proportional to current <i>i</i> in the circuit, the magnetic flux Φ aswell will be proportional to the current in the circuit.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>∣Φ(<i><b>B</b></i>)∣ ∝ |<i>i</i>|.</p>
</div>

<p>We write this proportionality as equality by introducing a constant <i>L</i>:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&Phi; = <i>Li</i></p>
</div>

<p>where <i>L</i> is known as self-inductance coefficient or <b>inductance</b> of the circuit, it depends on the geometry of the loop. If the current varies, the magnetic flux Φ through the circuit changes. By Faraday's law of induction, any change in flux through a circuit induces an electromotive force <i>ℰ<sub>L</sub></i>, (This EMF is called self-induced or the back EMF). in the circuit, proportional to the rate of change of flux</p>

<p>From Lenz's law we can deduce further that this induced electric field, always opposes further change in the current: The negative of the time derivative of current in this equation tells us that the induced EMF, and hence, the induced current will be in a direction that opposes the initial change of current: the negative sign indicates that the induced current is flowing in such a direction as to oppose the initial change of the current. The self-induced emf in a loop tends to maintain the current constant: that is, it opposes an increasing current and enhances a decreasing current Of course, when the current is steady and not changing then Eback will be zero. As a result, there is a kind of sluggishness in any coil of wire: it is hard to change the current, either to increase it or decrease it.</p>

<h3>Self-Inductance of a Solenoid</h3>


<h2>Magnetic Field Energy</h2>

<p>By analogy to the electric field energy stored in a charged capacitor, any loop (coil, solenoid) that carries a current flowing in its turns also stores magnetic field energy in the space occupied by the magnetic field. <br> In order to produce a magnetic field around a coil, energy is required; but no energy is needed to maintain it. This energy is stored in the magnetic field  and is not used up. For a decrease in the current there is also a decrease in the flux linked, causing the stored energy to be returned to the circuit.</p>

<p>Now let us consider and inductor connected to a DC source as shown in figure</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/RL_circuit.png" alt="RL circuit"/>
<figcaption>A series RL circuit. As the current increases toward its maximum value, the inductor produces an emf that opposes the increasing current.</figcaption>
</figure>

<ol type="i">
	<li><p>A part of the supplied energy is spent to meet <i>Ri</i><sup>2</sup> losses and cannot be recovered.</p></li>
	<li><p>The remaining part is spent to create flux around the coil (or inductor) and is stored in the magnetic field. When the field collapses, the stored energy is returned to the circuit.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Suppose at any instant the current in the coil is <i>i</i> and is increasing at the rate of d<i>i</i>/d<i>t</i>. Then the e.m.f. across <i>L</i> is given by</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>ℰ</i> = <i>L</i> d<i>I</i>/d<i>t</i></p>
</div>

<p>The instantaneous power, <i>P</i> = <i>ℰi</i> = <i>L</i> d<i>i</i>/d<i>t</i>. </p>

<p>During a short interval of time d<i>t</i>, the energy d<i>W</i> put into the magnetic field is equal to power multiplied by time i.e.,</p>

<p>Note that energy stored will be in joules if inductance, <i>L</i> and current <i>i</i>, are in henry and ampere respectively. Thus whenever current increases, the coil absorbs energy an whenever current falls, energy is returned to the circuit.</p>

<h2>Mutual Induction</h2>

<p>An experiment first conducted by Faraday demonstrated that a current can be produced by a changing magnetic field. The apparatus shown in Figure 1 consists of a coil connected to a switch and a battery. We call this coil the primary coil and the corresponding circuit the primary circuit. The coil is wrapped around an iron ring to intensify the magnetic field produced by the current in the coil. A secondary coil, at the right, is wrapped around the iron ring and is connected to an ammeter. The corresponding circuit is called the secondary circuit. It’s important to notice that there is no battery in the secondary circuit. At first glance, you might guess that no current would ever be detected in the secondary circuit. When the switch in the primary circuit in Figure 1 is suddenly closed, however, something amazing happens: the ammeter measures a current in the secondary circuit and then returns to zero! When the switch is opened again, the ammeter reads a current in the opposite direction and again returns to zero. Finally, whenever there is a steady current in the primary circuit, the ammeter reads zero. From such observations, Faraday concluded that an electric current could be produced by a changing magnetic field. (A steady magnetic field doesn’t produce a current unless the coil is moving, as explained below.) The current produced in the secondary circuit occurs for only an instant while the magnetic field through the secondary coil is changing. In effect, the secondary circuit behaves as though a source of emf were connected to it for a short time. It’s customary to say that <b>an induced emf is produced in the secondary circuit by the changing magnetic field</b>.</p>
