<h1>Angular Magnification and the Magnifying Glass</h1>

<p>If you hold a penny at arm’s length, the penny looks larger than the moon. The reason is that the penny, being so close, forms a larger image on the retina of the eye than does the more distant moon. The brain interprets the larger image of the penny as arising from a larger object. The size of the image on the retina determines how large an object appears to be. However, the size of the image on the retina is difficult to measure. Alternatively, the angle <i>&theta;</i> subtended by the image can be used as an indication of the image size. Figure 1 shows this alternative, which has the advantage that <i>&theta;</i> is also the angle subtended by the object and, hence, can be measured more easily. The angle <i>&theta;</i> is called the angular size of both the image and the object. The larger the angular size, the larger the image on the retina, and the larger the object appears to be.</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/size_object.png" alt="Size of an object"/>
<figcaption>The angle <i>&theta;</i>  is the angular size of both the image and the object.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>According to the definition of angle in radians, the length of the circular arc that is subtended by the angle is divided by the radius of the arc, as Figure 2 indicates.</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/magnification.png" alt="magnification"/>
<figcaption>a) The angle <i>&theta;</i>, measured in radians, in the arc length divided by the radius. b) For small angles (less than 9°), <i>&theta;</i> is radians is approximately equal to <i>h</i><sub>0</sub>/<i>d</i><sub>0</sub>, where <i>h</i><sub>0</sub> and <i>d</i><sub>0</sub> are the object height and distance.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Part b of the drawing shows the situation for an object of height <i>h</i><sub>0</sub>, viewed at a distance <i>d</i><sub>0</sub>, from the eye. When <i>&theta;</i> is small, <i>h</i><sub>0</sub>, is approximately equal to the arc length and <i>d</i><sub>0</sub>, is nearly equal to the radius, so that</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&theta; (in radians) = Angular size ~ <i>h</i><sub>0</sub>/<i>d</i><sub>0</sub></p>
</div>

<p>This approximation is good to within one percent for angles of 9° or smaller. In the next example the angular size of a penny is compared with that of the moon.</p>

<p><b>Example</b>. Compare the angular size of a penny (diameter = <i>h</i><sub>0</sub>, = 1.9 cm) held at arm’s length (<i>d</i><sub>0</sub> = 71 cm) with the angular size of the moon (diameter = <i>h</i><sub>0</sub> = 3.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> m, and <i>d</i><sub>0</sub> = 3.9 x 10<sup>8</sup> m).</p>

<p><b>Reasoning</b>. The angular size <i>&theta;</i> of an object is given approximately by its height <i>h</i><sub>0</sub>, divided by its distance <i>d</i><sub>0</sub>, from the eye, 9 ~ h,/d., provided that the angle involved is less than roughly 9°; this approximation applies here. The “heights” of the penny and the moon are their diameters.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b> The angular sizes <i>&theta;</i> of the penny and moon are</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><b>Penny</b>. &emsp;<i>&theta;</i> ~ <i>h</i><sub>0</sub>/<i>d</i><sub>0</sub> = 1.9 cm/ 71 cm = 0.027 rad (1.5°) <br>
<b>Moon</b>. &emsp;<i>&theta;</i> ~ <i>h</i><sub>0</sub>/<i>d</i><sub>0</sub> = 3.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> m/ 3.9 x 10<sup>8</sup> m = 0.0090 rad (0.52°)</p>
</div>

<p>The penny thus appears to be about three times as large as the moon.&emsp;■</p>

<h2>Magnifying glass</h2>

<p>An optical instrument, such as a magnifying glass, allows us to view small or distant objects because it produces a larger image on the retina than would be possible otherwise. In other words, an optical instrument magnifies the angular size of the object. The <b>angular magnification</b> (or <b>magnifying power</b>) <i>M</i> is the angular size <i>&theta;</i>’ of the final image produced by the instrument divided by a reference angular size <i>&theta;</i>. The reference angular size is the angular size of the object when seen without the instrument.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>M</i> = Angular size of final image produced by optical instrument / Reference angular size of object seen without optical instrument = <i>&theta;</i>’ / <i>&theta;</i></p>
</div>

<p>A magnifying glass is the simplest device that provides angular magnification. In this case, the reference angular size @ is chosen to be the angular size of the object when placed at the near point of the eye and seen without the magnifying glass. Since an object cannot be brought closer than the near point and still produce a sharp image on the retina, <i>&theta;</i> represents the largest angular size obtainable without the magnifying glass. Figure 26.39a indicates that the reference angular size is <i>&theta;</i> ~ <i>h</i><sub>0</sub>/<i>N</i>, where <i>N</i> is the distance from the eye to the near point. To compute <i>&theta;</i>’, recall from Section 26.7 and Figure 26.28 that a magnifying glass is usually a single converging lens, with the object located between the focal point of the lens and the lens. In this situation, Figure 3 indicates that the lens produces a virtual image that is enlarged and upright with respect to the object. Assuming that the eye is next to the magnifying glass, the angular
size  <i>&theta;</i>’ seen by the eye is  <i>&theta;</i>’ ~ h<sub>0</sub>/d<sub>0</sub>, where <i>d</i><sub>0</sub>, is the object distance. The angular magnification is</p>

<p>Two special cases of this result are of interest, depending on whether the image is located as close to the eye as possible or as far away as possible. To be seen clearly, the closest the
image can be relative to the eye is at the near point, or d<sub>i</sub> = −<i>N</i>. The minus sign indicates that the image lies to the left of the lens and is virtual. In this event, Equation 26.10 becomes <i>M</i> ≈ (<i>N</i>/<i>f</i>) + 1. The farthest the image can be from the eye is at infi nity (d<sub>i</sub> = −∞); this occurs when the object is placed at the focal point of the lens. When the image is at infinity, Equation 26.10 simplifies to <i>M</i> ≈ <i>N</i>/<i>f</i>. Clearly, the angular magnifi cation is greater when the image is at the near point of the eye rather than at infinity. In either case, however, the greatest magnifi cation is achieved by using a magnifying glass with the shortest possible focal length. Example 15 illustrates how to determine the angular magnification of a magnifying glass that is used in these two ways.</p>
