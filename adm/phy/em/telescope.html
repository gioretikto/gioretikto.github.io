<h1>Telescopes</h1>

<p>There are two fundamentally different types of telescope, both designed to help us view distant objects such as the planets in our solar system:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>the <b>refracting telescope</b>, which uses a combination of lenses to form an image;</p></li>
	<li><p>the <b>reflecting telescope</b>, which uses a curved mirror and a lens to form an image.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses placed coaxially. The one facing the distant object is called the <i>objective</i> and has a large aperture and large focal length. The other is calld the eye-piece, as the eye is placed close to it.</p>

<h2>Resolving Power</h2>

<p>A telescope also needs <b>resolving power</b>, which is the ability to distinguish between two distant objects (stars, say) whose angular separation is small. </p>
