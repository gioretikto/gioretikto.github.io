<p>The notion that magnetic fields can be used to store information and record or play back speech and music dates back to the 19th century. But the technology to do this was not easily achieved. Scientists and engineers developed magnetic tapes in the 1930s and 1940s, but these tapes were noisy and not widely used. The problem was that electromagnetic technology lacked sophistication—it was awkward and unreliable. Speech and music recordings at the time were more likely to be stored in the grooves of vinyl records called phonographs.</p>

<p>The development of reliable and inexpensive magnetic tape recorders came about in the 1960s. One of the chief motivations was the desire to listen to recorded music in cars (phonograph players would not work very well because of the motion and vibration). Engineers designed the eight-track cartridge to suit this purpose, but compact cassette tapes quickly replaced eight-track cartridges. Cassettes soon spread not only to car stereos but many other applications (and have only recently been themselves replaced, for most purposes, by compact discs).</p>

<p>Magnetic tapes are made with a flexible material coated with a thin layer of magnetic particles, such as compounds containing iron, cobalt, nickel—ferromagnetic materials. The device that writes and reads the information, called the head, is a miniature electromagnet containing a coil of wire wrapped around a small magnet.</p>

<p>First, a microphone transforms sound to be recorded into an electric current, which will be used to magnetize the particles on the tape in a certain way. A current flowing through the coil in the head creates a magnetic field, aligning the poles of the magnetic particles as the tape moves past. The figure shows an example of this kind of alignment. The amount of current flowing through the coil determines the strength of the coil’s magnetic field and the number of magnetic particles that are affected; the direction of current determines the direction of the pole alignment (for instance, whether the north pole of the particles is left or right). Any sound can be stored in the number and alignment of tiny magnetic particles embedded in the tape.</p>

<p>Playback occurs when the magnetized tape passes by the head. By electromagnetic induction, this produces a small current in the coil, proportional to the number of magnetized particles. The machine sends the electric signal to a speaker in order to transform it from current back to sound.</p>

<p>A serious problem with magnetic tape is that strong magnetic fields can erase the recordings by destroying the alignment of the particles. Magnetic fields such as those that surround power transformers will do this, as one young airman in the U.S. Air Force once discovered when he placed a tape full of important military information near a transformer and soon thereafter found, to his dismay, that all the information had disappeared. (This young air-man became much wiser in his later years, by the way, and is the author of this book.)</p>

<p>Computer disks also store information in the pole orientation of small magnetic particles. In computers, however, the information is usually stored to suit the binary language of these machines. Computers store and operate with information called data that are represented by long strings of 1s or 0s; each 1 or 0 is one data.</p>
