<h1>Sources of emf</h1>

<p>A current is maintained in a closed circuit by a source of emf. Among such sources are any devices such as batteries (see Fig. 1) and generators that increase the potential energy of the circulating charges. A source of emf can be thought of as a “charge pump” that forces electrons to move in a direction opposite the electrostatic field inside the source. The emf <span style="font-family: 'OpenSymbol', sans-serif;">ℰ</span> of a source is the work done per unit charge; hence, the SI unit of emf is the volt. <br> Consider the circuit in Figure 1 consisting of a battery connected to a resistor. We assume the connecting wires have no resistance. If we neglect the internal resistance of the battery, the potential drop across the battery (the terminal voltage) equals the emf of the battery. Because a real battery always has some internal resistance <i>r</i>, however, the terminal voltage is not equal to the emf.</p>

<p>The circuit of Figure 1 can be described schematically by the diagram in Fig. 1. The battery, represented by the dashed rectangle, consists of a source of emf in series with an internal resistance <i>r</i>. Now imagine a positive charge moving through the battery from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> in the figure. As the charge passes from the negative to the positive terminal of the battery, the potential of the charge increases by <span style="font-family: 'OpenSymbol', sans-serif;">ℰ</span>. As the charge moves through the resistance <i>r</i>, however, its potential decreases by the amount <i>Ir</i>, where <i>I</i> is the current in the circuit. The terminal voltage of the battery, &Delta;<i>V</i> = <i>V<sub>b</sub></i> − <i>V<sub>a</sub></i>, is therefore given by</p></p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&Delta;<i>V</i> = <span style="font-family: 'OpenSymbol', sans-serif;">ℰ</span> − <i>Ir</i>&emsp;&emsp;3.1.1</p>
</div>

<p>From this expression, we see that <span style="font-family: 'OpenSymbol', sans-serif;">ℰ</span> is equal to the terminal voltage when the current is zero, called the open-circuit voltage. By inspecting Figure 1, we find that the terminal voltage &Delta;<i>V</i> must also equal the potential difference across the external resistance R, often called the load resistance; that is, &Delta;<i>V</i> = <i>IR</i>. Combining this relationship with Eq. 3.1.1, we arrive at</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><span style="font-family: 'OpenSymbol', sans-serif;">ℰ</span> = <i>IR</i> + <i>Ir</i> &emsp;&emsp;3.1.2</p>
</div>

<p>Solving for the current gives</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>I</i> = <span style="font-family: 'OpenSymbol', sans-serif;">ℰ</span> / (<i>R</i> + <i>r</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>The preceding equation shows that the current in this simple circuit depends on both the resistance external to the battery and the internal resistance of the battery. If <i>R</i> is much greater than <i>r</i>, we can neglect <i>r</i> in our analysis (an option we usually select).<br> If we multiply Eq. 3.1.2 by the current <i>I</i>, we get</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>I</i> <span style="font-family: 'OpenSymbol', sans-serif;">ℰ</span> = <i>I</i><sup>2</sup><i>R</i> + <i>I</i><sup>2</sup><i>r</i></p>
</div>

<p>This equation tells us that the total power output <i>I</i> of the source of emf is converted at the rate <i>I</i><sup>2</sup><i>R</i> at which energy is delivered to the load resistance, plus the rate <i>I</i><sup>2</sup><i>r</i> at which energy is delivered to the internal resistance. Again, if <i>r</i> &lt;&lt; <i>R</i>, most of the power delivered by the battery is transferred to the load resistance.<br> Unless otherwise stated, in our examples and end-of-topic problems we will assume the internal resistance of a battery in a circuit is negligible.</p>
