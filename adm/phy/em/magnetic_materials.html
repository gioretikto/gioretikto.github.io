<h1>Magnetic Materials</h1>

<p>Each electron in an atom has an orbital magnetic dipole moment and a spin magnetic dipole moment that combine vectorially. The resultant of these two vector quantities combines vectorially with similar resultants for all other electrons in the atom, and the resultant for each atom combines with those for all the other atoms in a sample of a material. If the combination of all these magnetic dipole moments produces a magnetic field, then the material is magnetic. There are three general types of magnetism: <i>diamagnetism, paramagnetism, and ferromagnetism</i>.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p><b><i>Diamagnetism</i></b> is exhibited by all common materials but is so feeble that it is masked if the material also exhibits magnetism of either of the other two types. In diamagnetism, weak magnetic dipole moments are produced in the atoms of the material when the material is placed in an external magnetic field <i>B<sub>ext</sub></i>; the combination of all those induced dipole moments gives the material as a whole only a feeble net magnetic field. The dipole moments and thus their net field disappear when <i>B<sub>ext</sub></i> is removed. The term diamagnetic material usually refers to materials that exhibit only diamagnetism.</p></li>
	
	<li><p><b><i>Paramagnetism</i></b> is exhibited by materials containing transition elements, rare earth elements, and actinide elements. Each atom of such a material has a permanent resultant magnetic dipole moment, but the moments are randomly oriented in the material and the material as a whole lacks a net magnetic field. However, an external magnetic field <i>B<sub>ext</sub></i> can partially align the atomic magnetic dipole moments to give the material a net magnetic field. The alignment and thus its field disappear when Bex! is removed. The term paramagnetic material usually refers to materials that exhibit primarily paramagnetism.
	
	<li><p><b><i>Ferromagnetism</i></b> is a property of iron, nickel, and certain other elements (and of compounds and alloys of these elements). Some of the electrons in these materials have their resultant magnetic dipole moments aligned, which produces regions with strong magnetic dipole moments. An external field <i>B<sub>ext</sub></i> can then align the magnetic moments of such regions, producing a strong magnetic field for a sample of the material; the field partially persists when <i>B<sub>ext</sub></i> is removed. We usually use the terms ferromagnetic material and magnetic material to refer to materials that exhibit primarily ferromagnetism. The next three sections explore these three types of magnetism.</p></li>
