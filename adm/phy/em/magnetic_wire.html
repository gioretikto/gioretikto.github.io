<h1>Magnetic Force on a Current "Carrying Wire"</h1>

<p>If a magnetic field exerts a force on a single charged particle when it moves through a magnetic field, it should be no surprise that magnetic forces are exerted on a current - carrying wire as well. Because the current is a collection of many charged particles in motion, the resultant force on the wire is due to the sum of the individual forces on the charged particles. The force on the particles is transmitted to the “bulk” of the wire through collisions with the atoms making up the wire. <br> <p>The force on a current-carrying conductor can be demonstrated by hanging a wire between the poles of a magnet, as in Figure 1.</p>

<figure>

<figcaption><b>Fig.1</b>. A segment of a flexible vertical wire partially stretched between the poles of a magnet, with the field (green crosses) directed into the page.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this figure, the magnetic field is directed into the page and covers the region within the shaded area. The wire deflects to the right or left when it carries a current. <br> We can quantify this discussion by considering a straight segment of wire of length ℓ, and cross-sectional area <i>A</i> carrying current <i>I</i> in a uniform external magnetic field <i><b>B</b></i>, as in Figure 19.15. We assume that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the wire and is directed into the page. A force of magnitude <i>F</i> = |<i>q</i>|v<sub>d</sub> B</i> is exerted on each charge carrier in the wire, where <i>v<sub>d</sub></i> is the drift velocity of the charge. To find the total force on the wire, we multiply the force on one charge carrier by the number of carriers in the segment. Because the volume of the segment is <i>Aℓ</i>, the number of carriers is <i>nAℓ</i>, where <i>n</i> is the number of carriers per unit volume. Hence, the magnitude of the total magnetic force on the wire of length ℓ, is as follows:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Total force = force on each charge carrier x total number of carriers<br>
<i>F</i> = (|<i>q</i>|v<sub>d</sub> B</i>)(<i>nAℓ</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>From Topic 17, however, we know that the current in the wire is given by the expression <i>I</i> = <i>nqv<sub>d</sub>A</i>, so
the previous equation becomes</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>F</i> = <i>BIℓ</i></p>
</div>

<p>This equation can be used only when the current and the magnetic field are at right angles to each other. <br> If the wire is not perpendicular to the field but is at some arbitrary angle, as in Figure 2, the magnitude of the magnetic force on the wire is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>F</i> = <i>BIℓ</i> sin &theta;</p>
</div>

<p>where &theta; is the angle between <b><i>B</i></b> and the direction of the current.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig. 2</b>. A wire carrying a current <i>I</i> in the presence of an external magnetic field <b><i>B</i></b> that makes an angle <i>&theta;</i> with the wire.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The direction of this force can be obtained by the use of right-hand rule number 1. In this case, however, you must place your fingers in the direction of the positive current <i>I</i>, rather than in the direction of <b>v</b>, before curling them in the direction of <b>B</b>. The thumb then points in the direction of the force, as before. The current, naturally, is made up of charges moving at some velocity, so this really isn’t a separate rule. In Figure 19.16, the direction of the magnetic force on the wire is out of the page. Finally, when the current is either in the direction of the field or opposite the direction of the field, the magnetic force on the wire is zero.</p>

<h2>The physics of a loudspeaker</h2>

<p>Motst loudspeakers operate on the principle that a magnetic field exerts a force on a current-carrying wire. <br> One speaker design, shown in Figure 19.17, consists of a coil of wire called the voice coil, a flexible paper cone, and a permanent magnet. The voice coil is slipped over one of the poles of the stationary permanent manget (the north pole in the drawing) and can move freely. The two ends of the voice-coil wire are connected to the speaker terminals on the back panel ofa receiver. The receiver acts as an ac generator, sending an alternating current to the voice coil. The alternating current interacts with the magnetic field to generate an alternating force that pushes and pulls on the voice coil and the attached cone.</p>

<p>The coil of wire surrounding the north pole of the magnet is shaped so that the magnetic field lines are directed radially outward from the coil’s axis. When an electrical signal is sent to the coil, producing a current in the coil as in Figure 19.17, a magnetic force to the left acts on the coil. (This can be seen by applying right-hand rule number 1 to each turn of wire.) When the current reverses direction, as it would for a current that varied sinusoidally, the magnetic force on the coil also reverses direction, and the cone, which is attached to the coil, accelerates to the right. An alternating current through the coil causes an alternating force on the coil, which results in vibrations of the cone. The vibrating cone creates sound waves as it pushes and pulls on the air in front of it. In this way, a 1-kHz electrical signal is converted to a 1-kHz sound wave.</p>

<h2>Electromagnetic Pumps for Artificial Hearts and Kidneys</h2>

<p>An application of the force on a current-carrying conductor is illustrated by the electromagnetic pump shown in Figure 19.18. Artificial hearts require a pump to keep the blood flowing, and kidney dialysis machines also require a pump to assist
the heart in pumping blood that is to be cleansed. Ordinary mechanical pumps create problems because they damage the blood cells as they move through the pump. The mechanism shown in the figure has demonstrated some promise in such applications. A magnetic field is established across a segment of the tube containing the blood, flowing in the direction of the velocity <b><i>v</i></b>. An electric current passing through the fluid in the direction shown has a magnetic force acting on it in the direction of <b><i>v</i></b>, as applying the right-hand rule shows. This force helps to keep the blood in motion.</p>
