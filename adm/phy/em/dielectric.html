<h1>Dielectrics</h1>

<p>Think about what happens when a piece of insulating material is exposed to an electric field. If the molecules are non-polar, they will become polarized because the electrons will feel a force opposite to the field while the positively charged nuclei feel a force in the direction of the field. If the molecules are polar (Fig.1) they will go from a random alignment to being aligned with the field. Unless the applied electric field is very strong, the lectron cloud of a non-metallic atom is only moved, a little in the direction opposite to <i><b>E</b></i>. The atom then becomes a <i>dipole</i> with moment <i><b>p</b></i> pointing in the direction of <i><b>E</b></i>. If the field is not too strong, we have a relation <i><b>p</b></i> = <i>&alpha; <b>E</b></i> where <i>&alpha;</i> is a constant called the polarizability and we say that the material is polarized. <br> When a piece of insulator is inserted into a capacitor, we call the insulator a <b>dielectric</b>: an insulating material that doesn't allow conduction current to flow through because it doesn't have enough free electrons. It does, however, expercience <b>polarization</b> when placed in an electric field.</p>

<p>Consider a dielectric inserted between the plates fully occupying the intevening region. The dielectric is polarised by the field and, the effect is equivalent to two charge sheets (at the surfaces of the dielectric normal to the field) with surface charge densities <i>&sigma;<sub>b</sub></i> and -<i>&sigma;<sub>b</sub></i>. The electric field in the dielectric the corresponds to the case when the net surface charge density on the plates is &pm;(<i>&sigma;</i> -<i>&sigma;<sub>b</sub></i>). That is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>E</i> = (<i>&sigma;</i> -<i>&sigma;<sub>b</sub></i>)/<i>&epsilon;</i><sub>0</sub></p>
</div>

<p>The electric field from the polarized dielectric will partially cancel the electric field from the charge on the capacitor plates. This decreases the net field inside the capacitor, and decreases the potential difference across the capacitor. To return the capacitor to its original potential difference, more charge is needed. The net effect of the dielectric is to increase the amount of charge a capacitor can store for a given potential difference. The whole point of using a capacitor is to store charge, so coming up with a way to store more charge for the same amount of effort is a good thing. Thanks to polarization, a dielectric materials stores more electrical charges than vacuum , which means that a capacitor can store more electrical energy. This is the reason for placing dielectrics in capacitors. Examples of dielectric include dry air, nitrogen, ceramic, glass, and plastic. In

<p>The <b>Dielectric constant</b>, also known as electric permittivity or simply <i>permittivity</i> describes the ability of a material to accumulate electrical charge in response to the applied electrical field. Thus, the higher the permettivity, the more elcetrical energy can store the material. Typically, the permettivity of the materials, <i>ε</i>, is measured relatively from the permittivity of free space (<i>ε</i><sub>0</sub>), and for this is known as <b>relative permittivity</b>, <i>ε<sub>r</sub></i>.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>ε<sub>r</sub></i> = <i>ε</i>/<i>ε</i><sub>0</sub></p>
