<h1>Couloumb's Law</h1>

<p>In 1785, Charles Coulomb (1736–1806) experimentally established the fundamental law of electric force between two stationary charged particles: </p>

<ol>
	<li><p>It is directed along a line joining the two particles and is inversely proportional to the square of the separation distance <i>r</i>, between them.</p></li>
	<li><p>It is proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges, |<i>q</i><sub>1</sub>| and |<i>q</i><sub>2</sub>|, of the two particles.</p></li>
	<li><p>It is attractive if the charges are of opposite sign and repulsive if the charges have the same sign.</p></li>
</ol>

<div class="eq">
<p><b><i>F</i></b> = <i>k</i><i>q</i><sub>1</sub>q<sub>2</sub><b><i>r</i></b><sub>21</sub>/r<sup>2</sup><sub>21</sub></p>
</div>

<p>Here <i>q</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>q</i><sub>2</sub> are numbers (scalars) giving the magnitude and sign of the respective charges, <b><i>r</i><sub>12</sub></b> is the unit vector in the direction from charge 1 to charge 2, and <b>F</b> is the force acting between charges, and <i>k</i> is a proportionality constant, called <i>Coulomb constant</i>.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>k</i> = 1/4&pi;<i>&epsilon;</i><sub>0</sub></p>
</div>

<p>From experiment, we know that the Coulomb constant in SI units has the value, to five significant figures, of</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>k</i> = 8.9876 x 10<sup>9</sup> N ⋅ m<sup>2</sup>/C<sup>2</sup></p>
</div>

<p>The new constant <i>&epsilon;</i><sub>0</sub> is called the <i>permittivity of free space</i> and has the magnitude, measured in farads per meter (F/m),</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&epsilon;</i><sub>0</sub> = 8.85 × 10<sup>−12</sup> F/m</p>
</div>

<p>The force expressed by Coulomb's law is a mutual force, for each of the two charges experiences a force of the same magnitude, although of opposite direction. The Coulomb force is similar to the gravitational force. Both act at a distance without direct contact. Both are inversely proportional to the distance squared, with the force directed along a line connecting the two bodies. The mathematical form is the same, with the masses <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> in Newton’s law replaced by <i>q</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>q</i><sub>2</sub> in Coulomb’s law and with Newton’s constant <i>G</i> replaced by Coulomb’s constant <i>k</i>. There are two important differences: (1) electric forces can be either attractive or repulsive, but gravitational forces are always attractive, and (2) the electric force between charged elementary particles is far stronger than the gravitational force between the same particles, as the next example shows.</p>
