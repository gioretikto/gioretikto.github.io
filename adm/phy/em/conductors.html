<h1>Conductors</h1>

<p>On the basis of their behaviour under the influence of an external electrif field, we can divide the materials into two distinct groups:</p>

<ol type="a">
	<li><p>Those in which there asome electrons which are free to move in the presence of a field; Such materials in which an electric field produces a steady drift of charge (i.e. electric current) through them, are called <b>conductors</b>. Example of these are metals, carbon, etc. (There are among them some substance, both elements and compounds, the resistance of which vanishes at a certain critical temperature and they behave as <b>superconductors</b> ath the temperature, e.g., mercury at 4.2° K.</p></li>

	<li><p>Those in which electrons are strongly bound to the atoms or molecules composing the material and cannot be derached by the application of an electric field to these materials. Hence there is no steady motion of the electrons under the influence of <b>E</b>. Such materials are called <b>insulators</b> or <b>dielectrics</b>, e.g., sulphur, porcelain, mica, etc. It must be mentioned, however, that if the field is too large, catastrophic breakdown may occur in such substances. A good insulator breaks down in fields of about 10<sup>9</sup> volts/metre.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>We thus have perfect conductors and perfect insulators. Between these there is yet a third class of materials, the so-called <b>semiconductors</b>, with properties intermediate between conductors and insulators.</p>

<h2>Conductors in Electrostatic Equilibrium</h2>

<p>I materiali conduttori solidi, sono costituiti da un reticolo spaziale ai cui vertici si trovano gli ioni positivi e al cui interno si muovono gli elettroni liberi. In un metallo questi sono gli unici <i>portatoti</i> mobili di <i>carica</i>. Nel rame e nell'argento, in cui c'è un elettrone libero per atomo, il numero di elettroni per unità di volume coincide con il numero di atomi per unità di volume e abbiamo rispettivamente</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>n</i> = N<sub>A</sub> &rho;/A = 6.022 ⋅ 10<sup>26</sup> ⋅ 8.96 ⋅ 10<sup>3</sup> / 63.55 = 8.49 ⋅ 10<sup>28</sup> elettroni/m<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><i>n</i> = 6.022 ⋅ 10<sup>26</sup> ⋅ 10.5 ⋅ 10<sup>3</sup> / 107.87 = 8.49 ⋅ 10<sup>28</sup> elettroni/m<sup>3</sup></p>
</div>

<p>L'ordine di grandezza è lo stesso per tutti i conduttori metallici.</p>

<p>Il moto degli elettroni liberi in un conduttore in <b>equilibrio elettrostatico</b> è completamente disordinato. In qualsiasi volume <i>&tau;</i>, piccolo su scala macroscopica, ma contenente un numero <i>N</i> di elettroni abbastanza elevato (con <i>&tau;</i> = 10<sup>−18</sup> m<sup>3</sup> = 1 &micro;m<sup>3</sup>, <i>N</i> = <i>n &tau;</i> = 10<sup>29</sup> ⋅ 10<sup>−18</sup> = 10<sup>11</sup> elettroni), la velocità media è nulla</p>

<p>indicando con <i><b>v</b><sub>i</sub></i> la velocità dei singoli elettroni. Thus there is no preferential direction of motion of the electrons. We shall see that by applying an electric field <i><b>E</b></i> we cause an electric current in the conductor. Thus in <b>electrostatic equilibrium</b>, we have that</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i><b>E</b></i> = 0 &emsp; inside the conductor</p>
</div>

<p>Se si mettono a contatto due conduttori C<sub>1</sub> e C<sub>2</sub> isolati, a potenziali <i>V</i><sub>1</sub> e <i>V</i><sub>2</sub> diversi, si raggiunge una condizione di equilibrio in cui entrambi i conduttori si portano allo stesso potenziale. Nel processo un certo numero di elettroni passa dal conduttore a potenziale minore a quello a potenziale maggiore, sotto l'azione del campo elettrico <b>E</b> dovuto alla differenza di potenziale &Delta;<i>V</i>. Questo moto ordinato di elettroni in una certa direzione costituisce una <b>corrente elettrica</b> e il fenomeno è un esempio di <b>conduzione elettrica</b>. La corrente elettrica in questo caso specifico dura soltanto un tempo molto breve che impedisce l'esecuzione di studi sistematici del fenomeno. A tale scopo è necessario un dispositivo capace di mantenere una differenza di potenziale, e quindi un campo elettrico, tra due conduttori a contatto.</p>

<p>In <b>electrostatic equilibrium</b>, an isolated conductor (one that is insulated from ground) has the following properties:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>The electric field is zero everywhere inside the conducting material.</p></li>
	<li><p>Any excess charge on an isolated conductor resides entirely on its surface.</p></li>
	<li><p>The electric field just outside a charged conductor is perpendicular to the conductor’s surface.</p></li>
	<li><p>On an irregularly shaped conductor, the charge accumulates at sharp points, where the radius of curvature of the surface is smallest.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>Property 1</b>, can be understood by examining what would happen if it were <i>not</i> true. If there were an electric field inside a conductor, the free charge there would move and a flow of charge, or current, would be created. If there were a net movement of charge, however, the conductor would no longer be in electrostatic equilibrium.<br> <b>Property 2</b> is a direct result of the 1/<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> repulsion between like charges described by Coulomb’s law. If by some means an excess of charge is placed inside a conductor, the repulsive forces between the like charges push them as far apart as possible, causing them to quickly migrate to the surface. (We won’t prove it here, but the excess charge resides on the surface because Coulomb’s law is an inverse-square law. With any other power law, an excess of charge would exist on the surface, but there would be a distribution of charge, of either the same or opposite sign, inside the conductor.).</p>

</figure>

<p><b>Property 3</b> can be understood by again considering what would happen if it were not true. If the electric field in Figure 2 were not perpendicular to the surface, it would have a component along the surface, which would cause the free charges of the conductor to move (to the left in the figure). If the charges moved, however, a current would be created and the conductor would no longer be in electrostatic equilibrium. Therefore, <b>E</b> must be perpendicular to the surface.</p>

<p>this result is known as <b>Couloumb theorem</b>. It can be seen that <i>E</i> is the same for all points outside the surface of the charged conductor.</p>

<p>To see why property 4 must be true, consider Figure 3, which shows a conductor that is fairly flat at one end and relatively pointed at the other. Any excess charge placed on the object moves to its surface. Figure 15.19b shows the forces between two such charges at the flatter end of the object. These forces are predominantly directed parallel to the surface, so the charges move apart until
repulsive forces from other nearby charges establish an equilibrium. At the sharp end, however, the forces of repulsion between two charges are directed predominantly away from the surface, as in Figure 15.19c. As a result, there is less tendency</p>
 
<h2>Conductor in an Electrostatic Fields</h2>

<p>Let us consider what happens when a conductor is placed in an electric field, <b><i>E</i></b>. Under the influence of the field, the electrons can move around freely in the material but cannot leave the surface because strong forces act to prevent them from leaving. They thus, leave a net charge on the surface. The induced charges on the surface generate a field inside the conductor which is in a direction opposite to the external field, we indicated this induced electric field by <i><b>E<sub>i</sub></b></i>. The equilibrium is reached when the net electric field within the body of the conductor is such that <b><i>E</i></b> + <b><i>E<sub>i</sub></i></b> = 0, inside the conductor. Thus electrons will move to the surface unitl the net electrin field inside the conductor becomes zero.</p>

<p>Since an electric field cannot exist within the conductor under these conditions, the electric field lines do not penetrate the conductor. Instead, they end or begin on the induced charges.</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/E_field_lines_conductor.png" alt="E field lines inside conductor"/>
<figcaption>a) A cylindrical conductor (shown as an end view) is placed between the oppositely charged plates of a capacitor. The electric field lines do not penetrate the conductor. The blowup shows that, just outside the conductor, the electric field lines are perpendicular to its surface. (b) The electric fi eld is zero in a cavity within the conductor.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Since the electric field is zero inside the conductor, nothing is disturbed if a cavity is cut from the interior of the material, as in Figure 18.29b. Thus, the interior of the cavity is also shielded from external electric fields, a fact that has important applications, particularly for shielding electronic circuits. “Stray” electric fields are produced by various electrical appliances (e.g., hair dryers, blenders, and vacuum cleaners), and these fields can interfere with the operation of sensitive electronic circuits, such as those in stereo amplifiers, televisions, and computers. To eliminate such interference, circuits are often enclosed within metal boxes that provide shielding from external fields.</p>
