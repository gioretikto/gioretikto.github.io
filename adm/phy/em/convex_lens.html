<h1>Convex Surface, Low Refractive Index to High</h1>

<p>Mathematically, examining image formation with thin lenses is slightly more difficult than with mirrors: Snell’s law isn’t quite as simple as the law of reflection. We'll approach the problem in two steps by starting with the effect of a single spherical surface before considering two spherical surfaces together.</p>

<p>It is far more convenient to begin the study of refractive optics with lenses in air - it explains the workings of common optical devices, and it is vastly easier to perform experiments with light sources, lenses, and screens on a table than to devise experiments with a single curved, refracting boundary. However, single surfaces still create the illusion that an object being observed is now different in size or placement: looking into a curved fishbowl is one example.</p>

<figcaption>A light ray travels from <i>O</i> to <i>P</i> and undergoes refraction. The refractive index <i>n</i><sub>2</sub> is larger than <i>n</i><sub>1</usb>, and the angle of refraction <i>&theta;</i><sub>2</sub>, is smaller than <i>&theta;</i><sub>1</sub>, the angle of incidence. The lenght <i>y</i> has been exaggerated to clarify</figcaption>

<p>The figure above shows the incident and refracted rays when a ray from <i>O</i> is incident on a spherically curved interface between two materials with refractive indices <i>n</i><sub>1</sub>, and <i>n</i><sub>2</sub>, where <i>n</i><sub>2</sub> &gt; n<sub>2</sub></i>. The point labelled <i>C</i> is the centre of curvature of the curved surface. The angle of incidence at <i>P</i> is <i>&theta;</i><sub>1</sub>, the angle of refraction is <i>&theta;</i><sub>1</sub>, and they are related by Snell’s law: <i>n</i><sub>1</sub> sin <i>&theta;</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>n<sub>2</sub></i> sin <i>&theta;</i><sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Using the paraxial approximation discussed in the previous section, and assuming <i>d</i> ≈ 0.</p>
