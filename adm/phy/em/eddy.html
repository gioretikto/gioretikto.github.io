<h1>Eddy Currents</h1>

<p>Eddy Currents are circular currents induces within conductors by a changing magnetic field in the conductor, in accordance with <a href="Faraday.html">Faraday's law</a> of induction</i>. These are also referred to as <i>Foucault currents</i>. These flow in closed loops withing conductors, in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field. They can be induces withing nearby stationary conductors by a time-varying magnetic field created by an electromagnet or transformer, e.g., by relative motion between a magnet and a nearby conductor. The magnitude of the current in a given loop is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the area of the loop, and the rate of change of flux, and inversely proportional to the resistivity of the material. <br> By Lenz's law an eddy current creates a magnetic field that opposes the magnetic field that created it, and thus eddy currents react back on the source of the magnetic field. For exampole, a nearby conductive surface will exert a drag force on a moving magnet that opposes its motion, due to eddy currents induced in the surface by the moving magnetic field. This effect is employed in <i>eddy current breaks</i>, which are used to stop rotation power tools quickly when they are turned off. The current flowing through the resistance of the conductor also dissipates energy as heat in the material. Thus, eddy currents are a source of energy loss in alternatic current (AC) <i>inductors</i>, transformers, electric motors, and <i>generators</i>, and other AC machinery, requiring special construction such as <i>laminated magnetic cores</i> to minimize them. Eddy currents are also used to heat objects in <i>induction heating furnaces and equipment</i>, and to detec cracks and flaws in metal parts using <i>eddy current testing instruments</i>. </p>

<p>If the resistivity of a conductor was zero (as in perfect conductor), eddy-current loops would be generated with such a magnitude and phase to exactly cancel the applied magnetic field. A perfect conductor would oppose any change in externally applied magnetic field. Circulating eddy current would be induced to oppose any buildup of magnetic field in the conductor.</p>

<figcaption>(a) As you pull a solid conducting plate out of a magnetic field, eddy currents are induced in the plate. A typical loop of eddy current is shown. (b) A conducting plate is allowed to swing like a
pendulum about a pivot and into a region of magnetic field. As it enters and leaves the field, eddy currents are induced in the plate.</figcaption>
