<h1>Ampère's law</h1>

<p>During a lecture demonstration in 1819, Danish scientist Hans Oersted (1777–1851) found that an electric current in a wire deflected a nearby compass needle. This momentous discovery, linking a magnetic field with an electric current for the first time, was the beginning of our understanding of the origin of magnetism. <br> A simple experiment first carried out by Oersted in 1820 clearly demonstrates that a current-carrying conductor produces a magnetic field. In this experiment, several compass needles are placed in a horizontal plane near a long vertical wire, as in Figure 19.23a. When there is no current in the wire, all needles point in the same direction (that of Earth’s field), as one would expect. When the wire carries a strong, steady current, however, the needles all deflect in directions tangent to the circle, as in Figure 19.23b. These observations show that the direction of <b><i>B</i></b> is consistent with the following convenient rule, <b>right-hand rule number 2</b>:</p>

<blockquote>Point the thumb of your right hand along a wire in the direction of positive current, as in Figure 19.24a. Your fingers then naturally curl in the direction of the magnetic field <b><i>B</i></b></blockquote>

<p>When the current is reversed, the filings in Figure 19.24b also reverse. <br> Because the filings point in the direction of <b>B</b>, we conclude that the lines of <b><i>B</i></b> form circles about the wire. By symmetry, the magnitude of <b><i>B</i></b> is the same everywhere on a circular path centered on the wire and lying in a plane perpendicular to the wire. By varying the S current and distance from the wire, it can be experimentally determined that <b><i>B</i></b> is proportional to the current and inversely proportional to the distance from the wire. These observations lead to a mathematical expression for the strength of the magnetic field due to the current <i>I</i> in a long, straight wire:</p>
