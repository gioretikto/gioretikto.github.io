<h1>Cathode ray tube (CRT)</h1>

<p>All CRT monitors have a cathode ray tube(CRT), which is a vacuum tube. One end of this tube is a slender cylinder that consists of three electron guns. The wide end of the CRT is the display screen.</p>

<p>When power is applied to one or more of the electron guns, a stream of electrons is generated. This stream is subjected to a magnetic field generated by a ring of electromagnets called a yoke. The phosphor coating, when struck by the electron beam, releases energy as visible light.</p>

<h2>Phosphors and shadow mask</h2>

<p>Phosphors are dots inside the CRT monitor that glow red, green, or blue when an electron gun sweeps over them. Phosphors are evenly distributed across the front of the monitor. One group of red, green, and blue phosphors is called a triad.</p>

<p>Shadow mask is a screen that enables the proper electron gun to light the proper phosphor. Electron guns sweep across the phosphors as a group. The area of phosphors lit at one time by a group of guns is called a picture element, or <b>pixel</b>.</p>

<p>Monitor resolution is always shown as the number of horizontal pixels times the number of vertical pixels. Some common resolutions are 640X480, 800X600, 1024X768, 1280X1024, and 1600X1200.</p>

<h2>Video cards</h2>

<p>Video consists of two devices - the video card (or display adapter) and the monitor. The video card consists of two distinct components â€“ one to take commands from the computer and update its own onboard RAM, and the other to scan the RAM and send data to the monitor.</p>
