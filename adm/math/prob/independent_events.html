<h1>Independent Events</h1>

<p>We saw that in general the conditional probability of <i>E</i> given <i>F</i>, <i>P</i>(<i>E</i>|<i>F</i>), is not equal to <i>P</i>(<i>E</i>), the unconditional probability of <i>E</i>. In other words, knowing that <i>F</i> has occurred generally changes the chances of <i>E</i>’s occurrence. <br> Consider two events which might occur in succession, such as two flips of a coin. If the outcome of the first event has no effect on the probability of the second event, then the two events are called <b>independent</b>. For two coin flips, the probability of getting a "head" on either flip is 1/2, regardless of the result of the other flip.</p>

<p>Suppose that, when computing a conditional probability, we find that</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>P</i>(<i>E</i>|<i>F</i>) = <i>P</i>(<i>E</i>). &emsp; (<b>2.3.1</b>)</p>
</div>

<p>This means that the probability of <i>E</i> is not affected by the occurrence or nonoccurence of <i>F</i>. In such a situation, we say that event <i>E</i> is independent of event <i>F</i>. It can be shown that if event <i>E</i> is independent of event <i>F</i>, then <i>F</i> is also independent of <i>E</i>; thus <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> are referred to as <b>independent events</b>. Furthermore, from equation 2.2.1 we see that</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>P</i>(<i>E</i> ∩ <i>F</i>)/<i>P</i>(<i>F</i>) = <i>P</i>(<i>E</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>which can be written as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>P</i>(<i>E</i> ∩ <i>F</i>) = <i>P</i>(<i>E</i>) ⋅ <i>P</i>(<i>F</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Therefore, we state the following general definition.</p>

<p><b>2.2.1 Definition</b>. Two events <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> are said to be <b>independent</b> if and only if</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>P</i>(<i>E</i> ∩ <i>F</i>) = <i>P</i>(<i>E</i>) ⋅ <i>P</i>(<i>F</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Two events that are not independent are called <b>dependent events</b>. &emsp;□</p>

<p>The chance of all of two or more events occurring is called the intersection of events. For independent events, the probability of the intersection of two or more events is the product of the probabilities.</p>

<p>In the case of two coin flips, for example, the probability of observing two heads is 1/2 ⋅ 1/2 = 1/4. Similarly, the probability of observing four heads on four coin flips is 1/2 ⋅ 1/2 ⋅ 1/2 ⋅ 1/2 = 1/16. </p>

<p><b>2.2.2 Example</b>. A card is selected at random from an ordinary deck of 52 playing cards. If <i>A</i> is the event that the selected card is an ace and <i>H</i> is the event that it is a heart, then <i>A</i> and <i>H</i> are independent, since P(<i>A</i> ∩ <i>H</i>) = 1/52, while P(<i>A</i>) = 4/52 and P(<i>H</i>) = 13/52. &emsp;■</p>

<p><b>2.2.3 Example</b>. Suppose we roll a white die and a red die. If we let <i>E</i> be the event "We roll a 4 on the white die" and we let <i>F</i> be the event "We roll a 6 on the red die", are <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> independent events?</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>. The sample space for rolling a pair of dice has 6⋅6 = 36 elements. Using ordered pair notation, where the first entry represents the white die and the second entry the red die, we can list events <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> as follows.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>E</i> = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)}<br>
<i>F</i> = {(1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)}</p>
</div>

<p>Therefore,<i>E</i> ∩ <i>F</i> = {(4, 6)}. Because <i>P</i>(<i>F</i>) = 6/36 = 1/6, <i>P</i>(<i>E</i>) = 6/36 = 1/6, and <i>P</i>(<i>E</i> ∩ <i>F</i>) = 1/36.&emsp;■</p>

<p><b>2.2.4 Example</b>. Two coins are tossed. Let <i>E</i> be the event Toss not more than one head, and let <i>F</i> be the event Toss at least one of each face. Are these events independent?</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>. The sample space has 2⋅2 = 4 elements. The events <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> can be listed as follows.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>E</i> = {(H, T), (T, H), (T, T)}<br>
<i>F</i> = {(H, T), (T, H)}</p>
</div>

<p>Therefore, <i>E</i> ∩ <i>F</i> = {(H, T), (T, H)}. Because <i>P</i>(<i>E</i>) = 3/4, <i>P</i>(<i>F</i>) = 1/2, and <i>P</i>(<i>E</i> ∩ <i>F</i>) = 1/2, we see that <i>P</i>(<i>E</i> ∩ <i>F</i>) &ne; P(<i>E</i>)P(<i>F</i>), so the events <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> are dependent. &emsp;■</p>

<p>Sometimes the independence issue can be decided by the physical nature of the events in the problem. For instance, in Problem 3 it should seem evident that rolling a 4 on the white die is not affected by rolling a 6 on the red die. However, as in Problem 4, the description of the events may not clearly indicate whether the events are dependent. From a problem-solving viewpoint, the following two statements are very helpful.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>If <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> are independent events, then <i>P</i>(<i>E</i> ∩ <i>F</i>) = <i>P</i>(<i>E</i>)<i>P</i>(<i>F</i>). (This property generalizes to any finite number of independent events.)</p></li>
	<li><p>If <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> are dependent events, then <i>P</i>(<i>E</i> ∩ <i>F</i>) = <i>P</i>(<i>E</i>)<i>P</i>(<i>F</i>|<i>E</i>)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s analyze some problems using these ideas.</p>

<p><b>2.2.5 Example</b>. A die is rolled three times. (This is equivalent to rolling three dice once each.) What is the probability of getting a 6 all three times?</p>

<p><b>Solution</b> The events of a 6 on the first roll, a 6 on the second roll, and a 6 on the third roll are independent events. Therefore, the probability of getting three 6’s is 1/6 ⋅ 1/6 ⋅ 1/6 = 1/216. &emsp;■</p>

<p><b>2.2.6 Example</b>. Se si lanciano due dadi, qual è la probabilità che il punteggio totale sia 2?</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: 1/36. &emsp;■</p>

<p><b>2.2.7 Example</b>. Find the probability of drawing a black king from a deck of 52 cards.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>. The event <i>E</i> = "A black king is drawn", is composed of two events:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>E</i><sub>1</sub> = "A black card is drawn"<br>
<i>E</i><sub>2</sub> = "A king is drawn"</p>
</div>

<p>We want to calculate <i>P</i>(<i>E</i><sub>1</sub> ∩ <i>E</i><sub>2</sub>); We have that <i>P</i>(<i>E</i><sub>1</sub>) = 26/52 = 1/6. The event <i>E</i><sub>2</sub> is conditioned by <i>E</i><sub>1</sub> having a black card being drawn.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>P</i>(<i>E</i><sub>2</sub>|<i>E</i><sub>2</sub>) = 2/26 = 1/13</p>
</div>

<p>hence</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>P</i>(<i>E</i><sub>1</sub> ∩ <i>E</i><sub>2</sub>) = <i>P</i>(<i>E</i><sub>1</sub>) <i>P</i>(<i>E</i><sub>2</sub>|<i>E</i><sub>2</sub>) = 1/2 ⋅ 1/13 = 1/16</p>
</div>
