<h1>The Method of Exhaustion</h1>

<p>The <i>method of exchaustion</i> initiated by Antiphon the Sophist (<i>ca.</i> 430 B.C.), perfected by Eudoxus, and put to such excelence use by Archimedes that, if popular demand for a unique originator must be satisfies, he, rather than Newton and Leibniz, should be credited with the invetion of integral calculus.</p>

<p>A circle with inscribed and circumscribed polygons illustrates the principle of exhaustion method of measuring the value of &pi;. This method was used by many scholars, but probably the clearest description of this method was given by Archimedes. Essentially, it is a limiting process in which a unit circle (radius =1) is squeezed between two regular polygons - one inscribed in the circle, and one circumscribed about the circle. For each value of <i>n</i>, the perimeter or area of the inscribed polygon is less than the circumference or area of the circle, and the perimeter or area of the circumscribed polygon is greater than the circumference or are of the cricle. The lower boundary (inscribed polygon) approaches  the circle as a limit as <i>n</i> becomes infinitely large. The upper boundary (circumscribed polygon) approaches the circle as a limit as <i>n</i> becomes infinitely large. The circumference and area of the cricle are between these two boundaries. As <i>n</i> increases, so does the accuracy of the approximations for the circumference and area of the circle, and likewise, the accuracy (number of digits) of the approximation of &pi; also increases. Hence the name <b>Exhaustion</b> as the sequence of polygons fill up or <i>exhaust</i> the circle.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that Greeks did not have the same tools we have today. How were they able to construct such accurate polygons that were inscribed within the circles? Well the answer is that they used a straight edge and a compass. This would only work for specific polygons. “In 1837, mathematician Carl Gauss was able to prove that a n-polygon could be constructed with a compass and straight edge if and only if n is the product of a power of 2 and any number of the Fermat primes m = 22k,” wrote Chelsea E. DeSouza in The Greek Method of Exhaustion: Leading the Way to Modern Integration. The first polygons that would able to be constructed would be 3=2+1, 4=2<sup>2</sup>, 5=2<sup>2</sup>+1, 6= 2(2+1), 8 =23, 10=2(2<sup>2</sup>+1), 12=2<sup>2</sup>(3), 16=2<sup>4</sup>, 2<sup>4</sup>+1. Not all polygons were able to be constructed with a compass and straight edge.</p>
