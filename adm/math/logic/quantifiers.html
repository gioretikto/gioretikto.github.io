<h1>Quantifiers</h1>

<p>Not all mathematical statements are propositions which have a definite truth value. For example, consider the statement</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>x</i> is less than 5</p>
</div>

<p>where <i>x</i> is a real number. The assertion is true for some values of <i>x</i> and false for others. It is possible to convert such a statement into a proposition by using quantifiers, which are of two types, existential and universal. <br> The <i>existential quantifier</i> ∃ means “there exists”; other equivalent phrases are “there is at least one” and “for some”.<br> The universal quantifier &forall; means “for all”, equivalently, “for every”. <br> Thus, again thinking of <i>x</i> as a real number,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>∃<i>x</i> (<i>x</i> &lt; 5)</p>
</div>

<p>means that there exists an <i>x</i> such that <i>x</i> < 5; in other words, there is at least one real number that is less than 5. This is certainly true. On the other hand,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&forall; <i>x</i>(<i>x</i> &lt; 5)</p>
</div>

<p>means that for all <i>x</i>, <i>x</i> < 5; in other words, every real number is less than 5. This is definitely false.<br> More than one quantifier can appear in a sentence. For example, with <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> real,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&forall; <i>x</i>∃<i>y</i>(<i>x</i> + <i>y</i> = 13) &emsp;(1)</p>
</div>

<p>says that for every <i>x</i> there is a <i>y</i> such that <i>x</i> + <i>y</i> = 13. This is true; if you give me <i>x</i>, I can solve for <i>y</i>: <i>y</i> = 13 — <i>x</i>. However, consider the assertion

<div class="eq">
<p>∃<i>x</i>&forall;<i>y</i>(<i>x</i> + <i>y</i> = 13) &emsp;(2)</p>
</div>

<p>This says that for some <i>x</i>, every <i>y</i> satisfies <i>x</i> + <i>y</i> = 13; definitely false. There is a very convenient mechanical procedure for finding the negation of a statement involving quantifiers. Here is how it works in a typical case; let’s analyze the assertion</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>¬[(∃<i>x</i>) (<i>x</i> &lt; 5)]</p>
</div>

<p>We are saying that it is not the case that some <i>x</i> is less than 5; in other words, <i>every x</i> is greater than or equal to 5. Thus we have</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&forall;<i>x</i> (<i>x</i> &ge; 5)</p>
</div>

<p>Thus to go from ∃<i>x</i>) (<i>x</i> < 5) to its negation, we have reversed the quantifier (from ∃ to &forall;) and changed the main statement <i>x</i> < 5 to its negative. Similarly, to negate &forall;<i>x</i> (<i>x</i> &ge; 5) i.e., to say that “every <i>x</i> is at least 5” is false; we assert that some <i>x</i> is less than 5. So we arrive at</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>∃<i>x</i> (<i>x</i> &lt; 5)</p>
</div>

<p>which is not a surprise. Taking the negation twice brings us right back to the original statement.<br> This process works when there is more than one quantifier. For example, to negateate (1) above, notice that it is of the form &forall;<i>x</i> <i>P</i>, so that its negative is ∃<i>x</i>(¬<i>P</i>). But <i>P</i> is ∃<i>y</i> (<i>x</i> + <i>y</i> = 13), so not <i>P</i> is &forall;<i>y</i> (<i>x</i> + <i>y</i> &ne; 13). Thus the negation of (1) is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>∃<i>x</i> &forall;<i>y</i> (<i>x</i> + <i>y</i> &ne; 13)</p>
</div>

<p>which illustrates how the method works in general. Proceed from left to right, reversing quantifiers as you go, until you reach the main statement, which you change to its negation. The truth or falsity of a statement involving quantifiers depends crucially on the allowable values of the variables. For example, suppose we change (1) slightly:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&forall;<i>x</i> (∃<i>y</i> &gt; 0) (<i>x</i> + <i>y</i> = 13) &emsp;(3)</p>
</div>

<p>which says that for every real <i>x</i> there is a positive real <i>y</i> such that <i>x</i> + <i>y</i> = 13. This is false, e.g., take <i>x</i> to be 13 or larger. Taking the negation of (3) gives</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>∃<i>x</i> (&forall;<i>y</i> &gt; 0) (<i>x</i> + <i>y</i> &ne; 13) &emsp;(4)</p>
</div>

<p>which says that there is at least one real <i>x</i> such that every positive <i>y</i> satisfies <i>x</i> + <i>y</i> = 13. This is true; again, take x to be 13 or larger. If you add a positive number to <i>x</i>, you certainly can’t get 13. <br> <b>Caution</b>. The phrase “> 0” in (3) and (4) refers to the allowable values of the variable <i>y</i>. It is not changed when we go from a statement to its negation. <br>Perhaps you recall the definition of a limit from calculus, and perhaps you remember being baffled by it. The limit statement is actually a very complicated mathematical sentence using three quantifiers, and it is not surprising that it causes confusion. What does it mean to say the sequence <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>, ... of real numbers converges to the real number <i>x</i>? Intuitively, as <i>n</i> gets large, <i>x</i>, gets very close to <i>x</i>. How close? As close as you wish. For example, suppose we want the sequence to be within 10<sup>−9</sup> of <i>x</i>, ie., <i>x</i> — 10<sup>−9</sup> < <i>x<sub>n</sub></i> < <i>x</i> + 10<sup>−9</sup>. How large must n be? It might turn out in a particular case that all <i>x<sub>n</sub></i>,’s from <i>n</i> = 10<sup>15</sup> onward satisfy this inequality. Thus for every degree of closeness you might give me, there is some point in the sequence so that every x, from that point on is that close to <i>x</i>. The degree of closeness is measured by a small positive number &epsilon;, Ome in this case. The point in the sequence that achieves the desired closeness is measured by a positive integer <i>N</i>; in this case, <i>N</i> = 10<sup>15</sup>. We can then write the formal definition of convergence of <i>x<sub>n</sub></i>, to <i>x</i>:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>x<sub>n</sub></i> ⟶ <i>x</i> means (&forall;<i>&epsilon;</i> &gt; 0) (∃<i>n</i>)(&forall;<i>n</i> &ge; <i>N</i>) (|<i>x<sub>n</sub></i> − <i>x</i>| &lt; <i>&epsilon;</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>For every positive real number <i>&epsilon;</i> there is a positive integer <i>N</i> such that for every positive integer <i>n</i> = N, N+1, N+2, ..., <i>x<sub>n</sub></i> differs from <i>x</i> by less than <i>&epsilon;</i>. <br> If you did not understand the definition of a limit in calculus and it makes a bit more sense now, fine. If it is still obscure, there is no problem; we will not be using
it. I brought it up to make the point that quantifiers will be encountered in all areas of mathematics.</p>
