<h1>Conditional and Biconditional Statements</h1>

<p>Statements of the form “If P, then Q.” occur often and are very important in mathematics. The statement “If P, then Q.” is called a conditional statement, the statement P is called the <b>hypothesis</b> or <b>antecedent</b> of the conditional statement, and the statement Q is called the <b>conclusion</b> or <b>consequent</b> of the conditional statement. Here is one important example that encountered in a calculus course</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>If <i>f</i> is differentiable at the point <i>a</i>, then <i>f</i> is continuous at <i>a</i></p>
</div>

<p>For example, in the conditional statement “If n is a prime number greater than two, then n is odd.”, the hypothesis is “n is a prime number greater than two” and the conclusion is “n is odd.” Of course, conditional statements occur in every day life as well. For instance, you might recall conditional statements such as “If you clean your room, then you may go to a movie.” or “If you mow the grass, I will pay you twenty-ﬁve dollars.”<br> A conditional statement asserts that its hypothesis implies its conclusion. The conditional statement, itself, does not assert that its hypothesis is true, but only that if its hypothesis is true, then its conclusion is true. Furthermore, the conditional statement does not assert that its conclusion is true, but only that its conclusion is true if its hypothesis is true. Thus, when the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement are both true, we want the conditional statement to be true. And when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false, we want the conditional statement to be false. We denote the statement “If P, then Q.” symbolically by P ⇒ Q which is read “P implies Q” or “If P, then Q.” Just as with negation, conjunction, and disjunction, the conditional statement is deﬁned by its truth table. From the discussion above, the ﬁrst two rows of the standard truth table for P ⇒ Q should be as follows.</p>

<table class="centertable">
<tr><th>P</th> <th>Q</th> <th>P ⇒ Q</th></tr>

<tr><td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td> </tr>

<tr><td>T</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td></tr>

<tr><td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td></td></tr>

<tr><td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td></td></tr>

</table>

<p>The essential meaning of the conditional statement appears in the partial truth table above. Earlier, we indicated that in English the word “or” has two meanings—the meaning of the “inclusive or” and the meaning of the “exclusive or.” Since we have two missing truth values in the truth table for the conditional statement, there are four possible ways to complete the truth table. The question is: “For use in mathematical discussions, what truth value assignments should we make in the last two rows of the truth table?” Observe that when the hypothesis, P , is true, the truth value of the conditional statement P ⇒ Q is identical to the truth value of the conclusion, Q. Also observe that when P is true, the truth value of the statement (¬P )∨Q is identical to the truth value of Q. Hence, we deﬁne P ⇒ Q to be logically
equivalent to (¬P ) ∨ Q. That is, we take P ⇒ Q to be an abbreviation for (¬P ) ∨ Q. Below, we have constructed the standard truth table for (¬P ) ∨ Q and have attached at the right a column labeled P ⇒ Q. Since we have deﬁned the conditional statement P ⇒ Q to be logically equivalent to the statement (¬P ) ∨ Q, the column of truth values for P ⇒ Q is identical to the column of truth values for (¬P ) ∨ Q.</p>
