<h1>Tautologies and Contradictions</h1>

<p>Suppose, after contructing a truth table for a propositional sentence (statement), you see that each entry in the final column is true. This indicates a situation where the sentence is true no matter what truth values are assigned to its components. When this occurs, the sentence is called a <b>tautology</b>.</p>

<p><b>Definition</b>. We shall say that a propositional sentence is a <b>tautology</b> when its truth value is true regardless of the truth values of its components.</p>

<p>Thus, a propositional sentence is a tautology if it is always true. Take, for example:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>P or not-P</p>
</p>

<p>If P is true the statement turn out to be true. But if P is false, the statement still turn out to be true. From the following truth table that the sentence P ∨ ¬P is a tautology</p>

<table>
<tr><th>P</th> <th>¬P</th> <th>P ∨ ¬P</th></tr>

<tr><td>T</td> <td>F</td> <td>T</td> </tr>

<tr><td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td> </tr>

</table>

<p><b>Definition</b>. A <b>contradiction</b> is a statement that is false for every assignment of truth values of its component statements. Thus a contradiction is the negation of a tautology.</p>

<p>So the negation of the tautology P ∨ ¬P which is ¬(P ∨ (¬P)) is an example of a contradiction.</p>

<p><b>Definition</b> (<b>Truth Value Equivalent or Logically Equivalent</b>) Two statements are <b>truth value equivalent</b> or <b>logically equivalent</b> if and only if they have the same truth values for all assignments of truth values to their component statements.</p>

<p>It follows from the definition above that two statements which appear in the same truth table are logically equivalent if and only if their truth value columns are identical. Two statements which appear in different truth tables are logically equivalent if and only if both tables are in standard form, both tables are for statements with the same components, and their truth value columns are identical.<br> We need to develop an algebra for symbolic logic, so we can make calculations similar to the way in which we make algebraic calculations for real numbers. One algebraic property of real numbers is that −(−x) = x. So let us produce a truth value table for the statement ¬ (¬ P). We start our truth table with a row of column headings labeled P, ¬ P, and ¬ (¬ P). In the column labeled P, we enter as the first entry T and as the second entry F. (See 5a.) Then using the negation truth table, we compute the entries for the second column labeled ¬ P. Since negation changes the truth value T to F and the truth value F to T, the first entry in the second column is F and the second entry is T. (See 5b.) Applying negation to the second column, the column labeled ¬ P, we obtain T for the first entry in the third column and F for the second entry. (See 5c.)</p>

<table>
<tr><th>P</th> <th>¬ P</th> <th>¬ (¬ P)</th></tr>

<tr><td>T</td> <td>F</td> <td>T</td> </tr>

<tr><td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>F</td> </tr>

</table>

<p>Observe that the truth value entries in the first column are identical to the truth value entries in the third column. Hence, we have shown that the statements P and ¬ (¬ P) are truth value equivalent. In order to denote that P and ¬(¬P) are truth value equivalent or logically equivalent, we write P ≡ ¬(¬P), which is read “P is truth value equivalent to ¬(¬P)” or “P is
logically equivalent to ¬(¬P)” Thus, we have used a truth table to prove the Double Negation Law.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><b>Double Negation</b> Law: ¬(¬P) ≡ P</p>
</div>
