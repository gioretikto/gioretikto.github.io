<h1>Book I: Definitions</h1>

<p>The <i>Elements</i> starts with a set of 23 definitions.</p>

<p>D1. A point is that which has no part.</p>
<p>D2. A line is a breadthless length.</p>
<p>D3. The extremities of a line are points.</p>
<p>D4. A straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself.</p>
<p>D5. A surface is that which has length and breadth only.</p>
<p>D6. The extremities of a surface are lines.</p>
<p>D7. A plane surface is a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines on
itself.</p>
<p>D8. A plane angle is the inclination to one another of two lines in a plane
which meet one another and do not lie in a straight line.</p>
<p>D9. When the lines containing the angle are straight, the angle is called rectilineal.</p>
<p>D10. When a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles</p>
equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right, and the straight line standing on the other is called a perpendicular to that on which it
stands.</p>
<p>D11. An obtuse angle is an angle greater than a right angle.</p>
<p>D12. An acute angle is an angle less than a right angle.</p>
<p>D13. A boundary is that which is an extremity of anything.</p>
<p>D14. A figure is that which is contained by any boundary or boundaries.</p>
<p>D15. A circle is a plane figure contained by one line such that all the straight lines falling upon it from one point among those lying within the figure are
equal to one another.</p>
<p>D16. And the point is called the center of the circle.</p>
<p>D17. A diameter of the circle is any straight line drawn through the center and terminated in both directions by the circumference of the circle, and
such a straight line also bisects the circle.</p>
<p>D18. A semi-circle is the figure contained by the diameter and the circumference cut off by it. And the center of the semi-circle is that of the circle
<p>D19. Rectilineal figures are those which are contained by straight lines, trilateral figures being those contained by three, quadrilateral those contained by four, and multi-lateral those contained by more than four straight lines.</p>
<p>D20. Of trilateral figures, an equilateral triangle is that which has its three sides equal, an isosceles triangle, that which has two sides equal, and a scalene triangle that which has its three sides unequal.</p>
<p>D21. Further, of trilateral figures, a right-angled triangle is that which has a right angle, an obtuse-angled triangle that which has an obtuse angle,
and an acute-angled triangle, that which has three angles acute.</p>
<p>D22. Of quadrilateral figures, a square is that which is both equilateral and right-angled; an oblong that which is not equilateral but right-angled; a
rhombus that which is equilateral but not right-angled; and a rhomboid that which has its opposite sides and angles equal to one another but is neither equilateral nor right-angled. All other quadrilaterals are called trapezia.</p>
<p>D23. Parallel straight lines are straight lines which, being in the same plane and being produced indefinitely in both directions, do not meet one another
in either direction.</p>
