<h1>Similar Triangles</h1>

<p><b>Proposition</b> (<b>AAA similary theorem</b> <b>VI.4</b>) Equiangular triangles are similar.</p>

<p>This definition is known as the <b>Angle-Angle-Angle (AAA)</b> criterion for triangle similarity.</p>


<p><b>Proposition 20.4</b> (Sim SAS) (VI.6) Suppose that two triangles ABC and A'B'C' have the angles at A and A' equal, and the two sides AB, AC are proportional to the two sides A'B', A'C'. Then the two triangles are similar.</p>

<p>When we enlarge or reduct a shape by a scale factor, the original and the image have corresponing angles equal and corresponding sides in same ratio or proportion.</p>

<p><b>Theorem 1</b> (Proposition 5, Book  VI of The Elements) If two triangles are similar, i.e. they are equiangular, then the lengths of their corresponding sides are proportional. </p>

<p>Consider the triangles in Fig.1, because they are similar, their corresponding sides will be in the same ratio. This means that</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>AB/A'B' = BC/B'C' = AC/A'C'</p>
</div>

<p>It follows immediately from Theorem 1 that if &Delta;ABC ~ &Delta;A'B'C then there is a positive number &lambda;, called the <b>scale factor</b>, such that</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>AB  = &lambda; ⋅ A'B', &emsp; BC = &lambda; ⋅ B'C' &emsp; and AC = &lambda; ⋅ A'C'.</p>
</div>

<p>The converse to this proposition is also true. That is, we have the</p>

<p><b>Theorem 2</b> (Proposition 4, Book  VI of The Elements.) If two triangles have corresponding sides which are proportional. Then their corresponding angles are equal. That is, the two triangles are similar</p>
<p>While congruent triangles have the same size and shape, <b>similar triangles</b> have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. </p>

<p><b>Theorem</b>. Every parallel to one side of a triangle forms a triangle with the other two sides which is similar to the first.</p>

<p>To recap, when two triangles are similar we find that:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>their corresponding angles are equal (they are equi-angular);</p></li>
	<li><p>their corresponing sides are in the same ratio.</p></li>
</ul>
