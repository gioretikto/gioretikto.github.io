<h1>Proposizione I.4</h1>

<p>Proposition I.4 is the familiar side-angle-side (SAS) criterion for triangle congruence. (While we use SAS and other modern names for certain propositions, we note that in The Elements, no proposition has a name.) The word <b>base</b> is used in the Heath edition to indicate the third side of a triangle when the other two sides are under consideration. <br>
The statement of Prop. I.4 is the first place the word <b>subtend</b> appears in Heath’s edition of Euclid. “Subtend” means to stretch under and dates from the late sixteenth century. Curiously, the word <b>hypotenuse</b> has the same meaning and dates from just a bit later in the sixteenth century. As <i>hypotenuse</i> does not appear at all in the Heath edition, we must conclude that Euclid did not have a special term for the side of a triangle that subtends a right angle. Rather than say that a side subtends a particular angle, we would more likely say that a side is opposite the angle.</p>

<p><b>Proposition I.4</b>. (SAS). Suppose two triangles have pairs of corresponding
sides congruent, and the angles between them also congruent. Then the bases
of the triangles are congruent, the regions enclosed by the triangles are the same
size, and the angles subtended by congruent sides are themselves congruent.</p>

<p><i> Proof</i>. Let Δ<i>ABC</i> and Δ<i>DEF</i> be triangles with <i>AB ≌ DE</i>, <i>AC ≌ DF</i> and ∠<i>BAC</i> ≌ ∠<i>EDF</i>. If Δ<i>ABC</i> is positioned atop Δ<i>DEF</i> so that <i>A</i> is placed on the point <i>D</i> and <i>AB</i> placed on <i>DE</i>, then the point <i>B</i> must coincide with E because <i>AB ≌ DE</i>. <i>AB</i> coinciding with <i>DE</i> means the segment <i>AC</i> must coincide with <i>DF</i> because ∠<i>BAC</i> ≌ ∠<i>EDF</i>. The point C must coincide with
the point F because <i>AC ≌ DF</i>. Since B coincides with <i>E</i>, the base BC must coincide with <i>EF</i>. [If not, then the segments BC and EF enclose a space, which is impossible.] We conclude that <i>BC ≌ EF</i>, that the triangles enclose regions that coincide and are thus of equal size, and that the remaining angles of Δ<i>ABC</i> coincide with the remaining angles of Δ<i>DEF</i> so that ∠<i>ABC</i> ≌ ∠<i>DEF</i> and ∠<i>ACB</i> ≌ ∠<i>DFE</i>.□</p>
