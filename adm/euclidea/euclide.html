<h1>Euclide</h1>

<p>There are no contemporary accounts of Euclid’s life but there are some details about Euclid that scholars have been able to cobble together indirectly and about which there is little controversy.
It is generally held that Euclid founded a school of mathematics in Alexandria, Egypt<sup>3</sup>. In particular, Archimedes, 287–212 B.C., sometimes described as the greatest mathematician who ever lived, studied in Alexandria at Euclid’s school and cited Euclid’s work in his own writing. On the other hand, The Elements has detailed references to the works of Eudoxus and Theaetetus. To have learned their work, Euclid would have to have gone to Plato’s Academy. ([7], p. 2) Plato established the Academy outside Athens around 387 B.C<sup>4</sup>.  There is general agreement that Euclid was too young to have studied with Plato himself, and too old to have taught Archimedes in Alexandria. This helps narrow down the dates for Euclid which are currently accepted as about 325–265 B.C. As a student at the Academy, Euclid would have been the product of a rich tradition of careful thought, schooled in the writings and teachings of Plato, Aristotle, and the Greek geometers. Aristotle, himself a student of Plato, suggested in his own writings that his students had sources that codified the principles of mathematics and science, including geometry, that were accepted at that time. These sources presumably would have been available to Euclid as well. In other words, Euclid’s was not the first geometry text, even if we restrict attention to the West. This does not diminish its greatness but it is important to maintain perspective. One commonly accepted view of The Elements is that it pulled together what was known in geometry at the time, with the goal of proving that the five platonic solids are the only solutions to the problem of constructing a regular solid. There is room for doubt there, though, as several books of The Elements have nothing whatever to do with the construction of the platonic solids. ([7], p. 2) It is accepted by scholars that some of the work in The Elements was original. Euclid follows Aristotle’s rules of logic, for instance, but his use of postulates appears to be new.</p>

<p>3 Alexandria is named for Alexander the Great, who, as a child, studied with Aristotle.</p>
<p>4 Academy is actually the name of the place where Plato set up his institution. The Academy remained in use until 526, another astonishingly long-lived force in the intellectual world.</p>
