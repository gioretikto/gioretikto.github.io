<h1>Proposizione I.12</h1>

<p>Proposition I.12 does not appear at all again in Book I of The Elements
but it is particularly useful when we study properties of the plane that do not
depend on Postulate V. The proof is a lovely construction that may be familiar
from high school geometry.
Our presentation of the proof of Prop. I.12 includes an emphasis on Euclid’s
tacit assumption that a line divides the plane into two regions. This is one of
several tacit assumptions that concern the relative positions of points in the
plane. Assumptions of this type underlie many of the proofs in The Elements.</p>

<p><b>Proposition I.12</b>. We can construct a perpendicular to any given line at any
point on that line.</p>

<p><i>Proof</i>Suppose we wish to form a perpendicular to the line AB from a point C not on AB. C must lie on one side of AB; choose a point D on the other
side of AB. Construct the circle with center C and radius CD. Let E and G be points of intersection of the circle with AB. Let H be the midpoint of EG.
Since two sides of ΔGEC are radii, ΔGEC is isosceles so ∠HGC ≌ ∠HEC. As HG ≌ HE, we have SAS for ΔHGC ≌ ΔHEC so ∠GHC ≌ ∠EHC. 
As congruent adjacent angles, ∠GHC and ∠EHC must be right, so CH is perpendicular to AB</p>
