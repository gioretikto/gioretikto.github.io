<h1>Proposizione I.13 and I.14</h1>

<p>The proof of Prop. I.13 is the first place we run across the notion of angle addition in Euclid. Remember that Euclid does not use numerical measurements to compare angles and segments. Likewise, our use of the + notation should be taken as shorthand, not as a reference to the addition of numbers. In other words, any sums that arise in the following proofs are formal sums.</p>

<p><b>Proposition I.13</b>. A line segment standing on a second line segment makes two right angles or angles that sum to two right angles.</p>

<p><b>Proof</b>. Suppose <i>AB</i> stands on <i>CD</i> as in Fig. 1.13. If ∠<i>ABC</i> ≌ ∠<i>ABD</i>, the angles formed by the two segments are both right. If ∠<i>ABC</i> ≆ ∠<i>ABD</i>, stand the line segment BE perpendicular to <i>CD</i> so that ∠<i>CBE</i> and ∠<i>DBE</i> are both right angles. We have ∠<i>CBE</i> = ∠<i>CBA</i> + ∠<i>ABE</i>. Adding ∠<i>DBE</i> to each side, we have</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>∠DBE + ∠CBE = ∠DBE + ∠CBA + ∠ABE (1.1)</p>
</div>

<p>by CN2. Similarly, ∠ABD = ∠ABE + ∠EBD. Adding ∠ABC to each side, we have, again by CN2,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>∠ABC + ∠ABD = ∠ABC + ∠ABE + ∠EBD. (1.2)</p>
</div>

<p>Since the right-hand sides of (1.1) and (1.2) are the same, <a href="CN.html">CN1</a> implies</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>∠<i>ABC</i> + ∠<i>ABD</i> ≌ ∠<i>DBE</i> + ∠<i>CBE</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>As noted above, the sum of ∠DBE and ∠CBE is two right angles so this completes the proof.&emsp;□</p>

<p>Euclid did not use a special word for the relationship between angles that sum to two right angles but modern practice is to say that such angles are <b>supplementary</b>.</p>

<h2>Proposizione I.14</h2>

<p>Proposition I.14 is the converse of Prop. I.13, although it may be hard to tell on a first reading.</p>

<p><b>Proposition I.14</b>. Suppose two line segments, one on either side of a given line, meet the given line in a point so that the adjacent angles are supplementary. Then the two segments lie on a single line.</p>

<figcaption>Proposition I.14: Supplementary adjacent angles.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Proof</b>. Suppose <i>BD</i> and <i>BC</i> are segments extending on either side of a given line, <i>AB</i>. Suppose further that ∠ABD and ∠ABC sum to two right angles. The proposition says that B, C, D are collinear. Suppose they are not. If BD is not in a straight line with <i>BC</i>, then produce <i>BE</i> in a straight line with CB. With E that lies on the same side of AB as D.</p>

<p>Since the straight line AB stands on the straight line <i>CBE</i>. Proposition I.13 guarantees that ∠ABC and ∠ABE sum to two right angles. But the sum of the angles ABC and ABD also equals two right angles, therefore the sum of the angles ABC and ABE equals the sum of the angles <i>ABC</i> and <i>ABD</i>. Thus we have</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>∠<i>ABC</i> + ∠<i>ABE</i> ≌ ∠<i>ABC</i> + ∠<i>ABD</i></p>
</div>

<p>Subtract the angle ∠ABC from each side, then ∠<i>ABE</i> ≌ ∠<i>ABD</i> by <a href="CN.html">CN3</a>, the less equals the greater, which is impossible, this violates CN5. Therefore BE is not in a straight line with <i>CB</i>. Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except <i>BD</i>. Therefore <i>CB</i> is in a straight line with <i>BD</i>. &emsp;□</p>
