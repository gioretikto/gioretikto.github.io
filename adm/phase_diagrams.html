<h1>Phase Diagrams</h1>

<p>A <b>phase diagram</b> is a graphical way to summarize the conditions under which the different states of a substance are stable.</p>

<p>Figure 1 is a phase diagram for water. It consists of three curves that divide the diagram into regions labeled “solid,” “liquid,” and “gas.” In each region, the indicated state is stable. Every point on each of the curves indicates experimentally determined temperatures and pressures at which two states are in equilibrium. Thus, the curve <i>AB</i>, dividing the solid region from the liquid region, represents the conditions under which the solid and liquid are in equilibrium.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Solid &emsp;⇌&emsp; liquid</p>
</div>

<p>This curve gives the melting points of the solid at various pressures. Usually, the melting point is only slightly affected by pressure. For this reason, the melting-point curve AB is nearly vertical. If a liquid is more dense than the solid, as is the case for water, the melting point decreases with pressure. The meltingpoint curve in such cases leans slightly to the left. In the case of ice, the decrease is indeed slight—only 1°C for a pressure increase of 133 atm. For most substances, the liquid state is less dense than the solid. In that case, the melting-point curve leans slightly to the right.</p>

<h2>Vapor-Pressure Curves for the Liquid and the Solid</h2>

<p id="triple">The curve <i>AC</i> that divides the liquid region from the gaseous region gives the vapor pressures of the liquid at various temperatures. It also gives the boiling points of the liquid for various pressures. The boiling point of water at 1 atm is shown on the phase diagram (Figure 1).</br> The curve <i>AD</i> that divides the solid region from the gaseous region gives the vapor pressures of the solid at various temperatures. This curve intersects the other curves at point <i>A</i>, the <b>triple point</b>, which is the point on a phase diagram representing the temperature and pressure at which three phases of a substance coexist in equilibrium. For water, the triple point occurs at 0.01°C, 0.00603 atm (4.58 mmHg), and the solid, liquid, and vapor phases coexist. </br> Suppose a solid is warmed at a pressure below the pressure at the triple point. In a phase diagram, this corresponds to moving along a horizontal line below the triple point. You can see from Fig. 1 that such a line will intersect curve AD, the vapor-pressure curve for the solid. Thus, the solid will pass directly into the gas; that is, the solid will sublime. Freeze-drying of a food (or brewed coffee) is accomplished by placing the frozen food in a vacuum (below 0.00603 atm) so that the ice in it sublimes. Because the food can be dried at a lower temperature than if heat-dried, it retains more ﬂavor and can often be reconstituted by simply adding water.</br> The triple point of carbon dioxide is at −57°C and 5.1 atm (Fig. 2). Therefore, the solid sublimes if warmed at any pressure below 5.1 atm. This is why solid carbon dioxide sublimes at normal atmospheric pressure (1 atm). Above 5.1 atm, however, the solid melts if warmed.</p>

<p id="S">Sulfur has a more complicated phase diagram (Figure 1 bottom). It displays three triple points, one of them involving two different solid forms of sulfur (called rhombic sulfur and monoclinic sulfur), as well as the vapor.</p>

<h2 id="critical">Critical points and boiling points</h2>

<p>When a liquid is heated in an open vessel, the liquid vaporizes from its surface. At the temperature at which its vapour pressure would be equal to the external pressure, vaporization can occur throughout the bulk of the liquid and the vapour can expand freely into the surroundings. The condition of free vaporization throughout the liquid is called <b>boiling</b>. The temperature at which the vapour pressure of a liquid is equal to the external pressure is called the <b>boiling temperature </b>at that pressure. For the special case of an external pressure of 1 atm, the boiling temperature is called the <b>normal boiling point</b>, <i>T<sub>b</sub></i>. With the replacement of 1 atm by 1 bar as standard pressure, there is some advantage in using the standard boiling point instead: this is the temperature at which the vapour pressure reaches 1 bar. Because 1 bar is slightly less than 1 atm (1.00 bar = 0.987 atm), the standard boiling point of a liquid is slightly lower than its normal boiling point. The normal boiling point of water is 100.0°C; its standard boiling point is 99.6°C.<br><b> Boiling does not occur</b> when a liquid is heated in a rigid, <b>closed vessel</b> (Fig.2). Instead, the vapour pressure, and hence the density of the vapour, rise as the temperature is raised (Fig. 4.3). At the same time, the density of the liquid decreases slightly as a result of its expansion. There comes a stage when the density of the vapour is equal to that of the remaining liquid and the surface between the two phases disappears. The temperature at which the surface disappears is the <b>critical temperature</b>, <i>T<sub>c</sub></i>, of the substance. At the critical temperature, <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> characteristic for each gas, the attractive forces between molecules are not strong enough to produce liquefaction no
matter how high a pressure is applied.The vapour pressure at the critical temperature is called the <b>critical pressure</b>, <i>p<sub>c</sub></i>. At and above the critical temperature, a single uniform phase called a supercritical ﬂuid ﬁlls the container and an interface no longer exists. That is, above the critical temperature, the liquid phase of the substance does not exist.</p>

<h2>Carbon dioxide</h2>

<p>Imagine an experiment in which liquid and gaseous carbon dioxide are sealed in a thick-walled glass vessel at 20°C. At this temperature, the liquid is in equilibrium with its vapor at a pressure of 57 atm. You observe that the liquid and vapor are separated by a well-deﬁned boundary, or meniscus. Now suppose the temperature is raised. The vapor pressure increases, and at 30°C it is 71 atm. Then, as the temperature approaches 31°C, a curious thing happens. The meniscus becomes fuzzy and less well deﬁned. At 31°C, the meniscus disappears altogether. Above this temperature and above the critical pressure, there is only one ﬂuid state, called a <b>supercritical ﬂuid</b> (see Fig. 2). The temperature above which the liquid state of a substance no longer exists regardless of the pressure is called the <b>critical temperature</b>. For carbon dioxide it is 31°C. The vapor pressure at the critical temperature is called the critical pressure (73 atm for carbon dioxide). It is the minimum pressure that must be applied to a gas at the critical temperature to liquefy it.</p>

<blockquote>Quando un gas si trova a basse temperature ed alte pressioni, le particelle sono vicine una all'altra e le forze intermolecolari non possono essere trascurate. In queste condizioni è possibile il cambiamento di stato detto <b>liquefazione</b>. Tuttavia esiste una temperatura, diversa da gas a gas, che viene detta <b>temperatura critica</b>, <i>T<sub>c</sub></i>, al di sopra della quale il gas non può essere liquefatto, qualunque sia la pressione alla quale è sottoposto. (gas supercritico).</blockquote>

<p>On a phase diagram, the preceding experiment corresponds to following the vaporpressure curve where the liquid and vapor are in equilibrium. Note that this curve in Figure 1 top ends at a point at which the temperature and pressure have their critical values. This is the critical point. If you look at the phase diagram for water, you will see that the vapor-pressure curve for the liquid similarly ends, at point <i>C</i>, which is the critical point for water. In this case, the critical temperature is 374°C and the critical pressure is 218 atm.</br> Many important gases cannot be liqueﬁed at room temperature. Nitrogen, for example, has a critical temperature of −147°C. This means the gas cannot be liqueﬁed until the temperature is below −147°C.</p>

(<i>B</i>) The same two states in equilibrium at 30°C (just below the critical point); the densities of the liquid and vapor are becoming equal. (C) Carbon dioxide at 31°C (the critical temperature); the liquid and vapor now have the same densities—in fact, the distinction between liquid and vapor has disappeared, resulting in what is called a supercritical ﬂuid.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The phase diagram for carbon dioxide is shown in Fig. 3. The features to notice include the positive slope of the solid–liquid boundary (the direction of this line is characteristic of most substances), which indicates that the melting temperature of solid carbon dioxide rises as the pressure is increased. Notice also that, as the triple point lies above 1 atm, the liquid cannot exist at normal atmospheric pressures whatever the temperature, and the solid sublimes when left in the open (hence the name ‘dry ice’). To obtain the liquid, it is necessary to exert a pressure of at least 5.11 atm. Cylinders of carbon dioxide generally contain the liquid or compressed gas; at 25°C that implies a vapour pressure of 67 atm if both gas and liquid are present in equilibrium. When the gas squirts through the throttle it cools by the <a href="Joule_Thomson_effect.html">Joule–Thomson effect</a>, so when it emerges into a region where the pressure is only 1 atm, it condenses into a finely divided snow-like solid.</p>

<h2>p-V diagrams</h2>

<p>In a <b>p-V</b> diagram, the temperature is ketps constant, volume decreased and pressure recorded.</p>

<p>Figure 4 presents different isotherms in a pressure−molar volume−temperature diagram (known also as Andrews' diagram). The molar volume <i>V̄</i> = <i>V</i>/<i>n</i>, is the volume occupied by a substance at a particular temperature and pressure. Once <i>V<sub>m</sub></i> is known, the density corresponding to a particular <i>V̄</i> can be calculated as <i>&rho;</i> = <i>M</i>/<i>V<sub>m</sub></i>, where <i>M</i> is the molecular weight of the substance. This means that <i>V̄</i> is proportional to 1/<i>&rho;</i> for a particular substance.<br> 

<p>A line, which connects the state of one phase with the state of another phase with which it is in equilibrium, is called a <b>tie line</b>. Two tie lines are shown in Fig. 4. The pressure in this case is the equilibrium vapor pressure of the liquid.</p> </p>

<figure>
<img src="img/isotherms_liquid_vapor.png" alt="isoterms liquid vapour"/>
<figcaption><b>Fig.4</b> Pressure−density diagram for a pure substance at different isotherms. </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As the temperature is raised, the tie line becomes shorter, and the molar volumes of the liquid and gas approach each other. At the critical point <i>C</i> the tie line vanishes and the distinction between liquid and gas is lost. The critical point, <i>C</i>, represents the maximum tempeature at which the substance can be found as a liquid. At temperatures above the critical temperature, there is a single fluid phase. Above the critical point a gas may have a very high density, and it may be characterized as a supercritical fluid.<br> The isotherm that goes through the critical point is known as <b>critical isotherm</b>. At point <i>C</i> for every substance there will be a specific critical molar volume <i>V̄<sub>c</sub></i> and a critical pressure <i>P<sub>c</sub></i>. The critical isotherm has the following two properties: It is horizontal at the critical point,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>(∂<i>P</i>/∂<i>V̄</i>)<sub><i>T</i> = <i>T<sub>c</sub></sub></i> = 0</p>
</div>

<p>and it has a point of inflection at the critical point, i.e. also the second derivative is zero</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>(∂<sup>2</sup><i>P</i>/∂<sup>2</sup><i>V̄</i>)<sub><i>T</i> = <i>T<sub>c</sub></sub></i> = 0</p>
</div>

<p>At the critical point the <b>isothermal compressibility</b> [<i>k</i> = −<i>V̄</i><sup>−1</sup>(∂<i>P</i>/∂<i>V</i>)<sub><i>T</i></sub>;] becomes infinite because (∂<i>P</i>/∂<i>V</i>)<sub><i>T</i> = <i>T<sub>c</sub></sub></i> = 0. If the isothermal compressibility is very large, as it is in the neighborhood of the critical point, very little work is required to compress the fluid. Therefore, gravity sets up large differences in density between the top and bottom of the container, as large as 10% in a column of fluid only a few centimeters high. This makes it difficult to determine <i>PV̄</i> isotherms near the critical point. These large differences, or <b>spontaneous fluctuations</b>, in the density can extend over macroscopic distances. The distance may be as large as the wavelength of visible light or larger. Since fluctuations in density are accompanied by fluctuations in refractive index, light is strongly scattered, and this is called <b>critical opalescence</b>.</p>

<p>In the table below number of substances are given, along with the compressibility factor at the critical point <i>Z<sub>c</sub></i> = <i>P<sub>c</sub> V̄<sub>c</sub></i>/ <i>RT<sub>c</sub></i>, and the Boyle temperature <i>T<sub>B</sub></i></p>

<h3>Gas vs Vapor</h3>

<p>Gases may be liquefied in two ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>By cooling, which reduces the dispersive effect produced by the thermal energy of the molecules;</p></li>
	<li><p>By compression which brings the molecules closer together, thus increasing the attractive force between them;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Sulphur dioxide was first liqefied by cooling (at atmospheric pressure) in 1800 (Monge and Clouet), and by compression in 1806 (Northmore). In 1823 Faraday, using both cooling and compression, liquefied a number of gases including chlorine, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen Sulphide, etc, and these came to be known as <b>permanent gases</b>. For a long time a "<b>gas</b>" and a "<b>vapor</b>" were thought to be different in the sense that only the latter could be trasformed into liquid, say, by pressurization at constant temperature. <br> Thomas Andrews, of Queen's College, Belfast clarified the the concepts of gas, vapor and the relation with critical temperature. The reason for Faraday's failure was made clear by Andrews's studies, of carbon dioxide in 1869. Depending on temperature and pressure, CO<sub>2</sub> can be in liquid, gas, solid, or supercritical phase. Andrews found that CO<sub>2</sub> gas would transform to a liquid if the pressure on the gas was increased but only as long as the temperature was kept below 304 K (31°C) − Critical temperature. However, beyond this temperature, it was impossible to convert CO<sub>2</sub> gas to liquid by further compression. The reported value found by Andrews agrees well with today's accepted value of 304.05 K for the critical temperature and 7.38 MPa for the critical pressure.</p>

<p>Notice that no critical end point exists on the other coexistence curves in the phase diagram of water. For example there is no critical end point on the solid-liquid phase boundary. The distinction between the properties of liquid and vapor phases is purely quantitiative in nature. In booth liquid and vapor the water molecules are distributed randomly but the interactions between the molecules in the gas is weaker than those in the liquid. Conversely the distinction between liquid water and ice and between ice and vapor is qualitative in nature since ice has a crystal structure with symmetry properties.</p>

<h3>Removing Caffeine from Coffee </br> Decaf coffee: Coffee that was “naturally decaffeinated” using supercritical carbon dioxide</h3>

<p>Above its critical temperature a gas does not condense or evaporate to form a liquid or a gas but is a fluid, with porperties changing continuosly from gas-like to liquid-like as the pressure increases. Le proprietà dei fluidi supercritici sono generalmente intermedie tra quelle dello stesso composto allo stato liquido ed a quello aeriforme: la densità è più simile a quella del liquido, mentre la viscosità si avvicina a quella del gas e la diffusività ha proprietà intermedie. Infinite il potere di solvatazione è generalmente più simile a quello del liquido. Quest'ultima proprietà è importante, dato che la principale applicazione dei fluidi supercritici consiste nell'estrazione di materiale organico. Rispetto allo stato liquido, una sostanza allo stato supercritico presenta alcune caratteristiche tipiche, riassunte in:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Densità leggermente inferiore;</p></li>
	<li><p>Viscosità notevolmente più bassa (paragonabile a quella dei gas;</p></li>
	<li><p>Mggiore diffusività;</p></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Grazie alle loro particolari proprietà, i fluidi supercritici possono essere impiegati con risultati eccellenti nelle operazioni di separazione, in luogo dei classici solventi. La capacità di solubilizzare un soluto è infatti unfzione della densità di fluido e dell'affinità in polarità tra le due sostanze. In aggiunta con i fluidi supercritici è possibile regolare in maniera continua il potere solvente, senza incorrere in transizioni di fase. È sufficiente, infatti, modulare le condizioni di <i>P</i> e <i>T</i> per ottenere una perfetta regolazione della densità del fluido.</p>

<p>Legend has it that a goat herder named Kaldi, in the ancient country of Abyssinia (now Ethiopia, in north-east Africa), discovered the pleasant effect of coffee beans when he
noted that his goats danced wildly about after eating the shiny leaves and red berries of a small tree. Later he tried eating the whole berries himself, and he soon found that he was dancing with his goats. Whether the legend is true or not, it does effectively describe the stimulant effect of this berry from the coffee tree. As we now know, coffee, which today is obtained by roasting the berries’ green pits, or beans as they are called, contains the stimulant caffeine, a bitter-tasting white substance with the formula C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. For those who like the taste of roasted coffee but don’t want the caffeine, decaffeinated coffee is available. A German chemist, Ludwig Roselius, ﬁrst made “decaf” coffee about 1900 by extracting the caffeine from green coffee beans with the solvent chloroform, CHCl<sub>3</sub>. Later, commercial processes replaced chloroform with the safer organic sol- vent methylene chloride, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. Today, though, most of the commercial decaffeinated coffee produced uses supercritical carbon dioxide as the extracting ﬂuid. In a tank of carbon dioxide under pressure (for example, in a CO<sub>2</sub> ﬁre extinguisher), the substance normally exists as the liquid in equilibrium with its gas phase. But we know from the previous text discussion that above 31°C, the two phases, gas and liquid, are replaced by a single ﬂuid phase. So, on a hot summer day (above 31°C), the carbon dioxide in such a tank is above its critical temperature and pressure and exists as the supercritical ﬂuid.</p>

<p>Supercritical carbon dioxide is a near-ideal solvent. Under normal conditions, carbon dioxide is not a very good solvent for organic substances, but supercritical carbon
dioxide readily dissolves many of these substances, including caffeine. It is nontoxic and nonﬂammable. It also has no effect on the stratospheric ozone layer, whereas methylene chloride does. (See the essay on <a href="../chemistry/general/ozone.html">stratospheric ozone</a>) Carbon dioxide does contribute to the greenhouse effect, but the gas once used can be recirculated for solvent use and not vented to the atmosphere. Supercritical ﬂuids have gained much attention recently because of the possibility of replacing toxic and environmentally less desirable solvents. For example, at the moment, the usual solvent used to dry-clean clothes is perchloroethylene, CCl<sub>2</sub>CCl<sub>2</sub>. Although nonﬂammable and less toxic than carbon tetrachloride, which was the solvent previously used, perchloroethylene is regulated as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act. Some scientists have shown that you can dry-clean with supercritical carbon dioxide if you use a special detergent. Substances other than carbon dioxide have also shown intriguing solvent properties. For example, whereas water under normal conditions dissolves ionic and polar substances, above its critical point (374°C, 217 atm) it becomes an excellent solvent for nonpolar substances. Supercritical water and carbon dioxide promise to replace many toxic or environmentally unfriendly organic solvents.</p>

<h2>Water</h2>

<p>Figure 2 is the phase diagram for water. The liquid–vapour boundary in the phase diagram summarizes how the vapour pressure of liquid water varies with temperature. It also summarizes how the boiling temperature varies with pressure: we simply read off the temperature at which the vapour pressure is equal to the prevailing atmospheric pressure. The solid–liquid boundary shows how the melting temperature varies with the pressure. Its very steep slope indicates that enormous pressures are needed to bring about significant changes. Notice that the line has a negative slope up to 2 kbar, which means that the melting temperature falls as the pressure is raised. The reason for this almost unique behaviour can be traced to the decrease in volume that occurs on melting, and hence it being more favourable for the solid to transform into the liquid as the pressure is raised. The decrease in volume is a result of the very open molecular structure of ice: as shown in Fig 4.6, the water molecules are held apart, as well as together, by the hydrogen bonds between them but the structure partially collapses on melting and the liquid is denser than the solid. Figure 2 shows that water has one liquid phase but many different solid phases other than ordinary ice (‘ice I’, shown in Fig. 2). Some of these phases melt at high temperatures. Ice VII, for instance, melts at 100°C but exists only above 25 kbar. Note that five more triple points occur in the diagram other than the one where vapour, liquid, and ice I coexist. Each one occurs at a definite pressure and temperature that cannot be changed. The solid phases of ice differ in the arrangement of the water molecules: under the influence of very high pressures, hydrogen bonds buckle and the H<sub>2</sub>O molecules adopt different arrangements. These <b>polymorphs</b>, or different solid phases, of ice may be responsible for the advance of glaciers, for ice at the bottom of glaciers experiences very high pressures where it rests on jagged rocks.</p>

<h2>Helium</h2>

<p>Figure 4.7 shows the phase diagram of helium. Helium behaves unusually at low temperatures. For instance, the solid and gas phases of helium are never in equilibrium however low the temperature: the atoms are so light that they vibrate with a large-amplitude motion even at very low temperatures and the solid simply shakes itself apart. Solid helium can be obtained, but only by holding the atoms together by applying pressure. When considering helium at low temperatures it is necessary to distinguish between the isotopes 3 He and 4 He. Pure helium-4 has two liquid phases. The phase marked He-I in the diagram behaves like a normal liquid; the other phase, He-II, is a <b>superfluid</b>; it is so called because it flows without viscosity. 1 Provided we discount the liquid crystalline substances discussed in Section 6.6, helium is the only known substance with a liquid–liquid boundary, shown as the λ-<b>line</b> (lambda line) in Fig. 4.7. The phase diagram of helium-3 differs from the phase diagram of helium-4, but it also possesses a superfluid phase. Helium-3 is unusual in that the entropy of the liquid is lower than that of the solid, and melting is exothermic</p>
