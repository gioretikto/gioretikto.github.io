<p><b>1 ... e5</b> Black opens lines for two of his pieces and establishes equilibrium in hte centre.</p>

<p><b>2 f4</b> An offer of a pawn to induce Black to surrender his share of the centre. Accepting the gift enable White to continue with 3 Nf3, followed by 4 d4, and dominate the centre with his pawsn. In addition, the opening of the f-file will offer White the opportunity of directing his attack at the vulnerable point f7. This is a tender spot whethet Black's king stays at home or castles.</p>

<p><b>2 ... Bc5</b> Probably the safer way to decline the gamit: 1) The bishop bears down on the centre and controls an excellent diagonal 2) The bishop supplements the pawn's attack on d4 and prevents White from moving his d-pawn to d4. 3) The bishop's presence at c5, overlooking g1, forbids. White from castling in a hurry. </p>

<p><b>3 Nc3</b> White avoids 3 fxe5 because the reply (coming like a shot, probbly 3...Qh4+ 4 g3 (even worse is 4 Ke2 Qxe4#) 4... Qxe4+ wins a rook for Black.</p> 

<p><b>3 ... Nc6</b> Black continues mustering his forces on the field of action. In the fight for control of the centre, his knight foes its share by exerting pressure on the squares c5 and d4.</p>

<p><b>4 Nf3</b> The text-move puts an end to the possibility of being bothered by a queen check and revives the threat of winning the e-pawn.</p>

<p><b>4.... exf4</b> This is a poor move on at least four counts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In moving a pawn insted of a piece, Black loses sight of the chied objective in all opening strategy: Move the pieces! Get them off the back rank and on the the job!</p></li>

<li><p>He surrenders his hold on the centre and the privileges it confers.</p></li>

<li><p>He wastes time capturing a pawn which he cannot retain.</p></li>

<li><p>He permits White to seize the centre next move, which forces a retreat by his bishop and a consequent loo of time.</p></li>

</ol>

<p><b>5 d4!</b> Of Course! No player should take more than half a second to see the power of this pawn push! The pawn seizes control of a good bit of the centre, dislodges the bishop form its strong position, and uncovers an attack by his own c1-bishop on the f4-pawn.</p>

<p><b>5 ... B4</b> It would have been sounder strategy to retreat to e7 instead, where the bishop is invaluable for defence.</p>

<p><b>6 Bxf4</b> White gains a tempo with this capture, as he recevers the lost pawn and develops a piece at the same time.</p>

<p><b>6 ... d5</b> Black attacks the white e-pawn, disputing possession of the centre. Meanwhile, Black gives this quee-side pieces more air.</p>

<p><b>7 e5</b> All pawn moves have positive and negative aspects. IT deprives the knight which operates to great advantage when posted at e5. But in compensation, the pawn exercises a cramping effect on Black's entire position and imposes particular restraint on Black's king's knight, which cannot develop naturally at f6.</p>

<p><b>7 ... Bxc3</b> </p>

<p><b>8 bxc3</b> In return for the handicap of the doubled pawns (little enough, since the advance c4 forces an exchange and undoubles the pawns)  White enjoys advantages in his two bishops and in the open b-file which his rook will put to good use.</p>

<p><b>8 ... Be6</b> A superficial move, as the bishop could develop to greater effect at f5. Thre it would hinder White form freely posting his bishop at d3, excepts at the cost of permitting the bishops to be exchanged.</p>

<p><b>9 Bd3</b> Clearly an excellent deployment: the biship reaches out in two directions, ready to take a hand on either side of the board. Apprarenly to prevent 19 Ng5 or 10 Bg5.</p>

<p><b>10 O-O</b> At one stroke White secures the safety of his king and brings his rook on to an open file. It is true that the file is cluttered up by a knight and bishiop, which interfere with the rook's influence, but the are pieces, not paws, and can move quicly out of the way.</p>

<p><b>10 ... Nge7</b> Not the happiest spot for the knight, but how else can it get into the game?</p>

<p><b>11 Rb1</b> seize any files that are open- control them at once with his rooks or queen</p>

<p><b>11 ... b6</b> A master woul try to avoid disturbing the pawn formation and consider instead such alternatives as 11 ... Rb8 or 11...Qc8</p>

<p><b>12 Qd2</b> The quuen leaves the first rank to enable rooks to get in touch with each other.</p>

<p><b>12 ... O-O</b> Walking right into teeth of the storm! Before makiing this move Black might have asked himself "How can I exploit White's one weakness, the doubled pawns on the c-file?"</p>

<p><b>13 Bxh6</b> At the price of a bishop, he immediately gets two pawn as material return, demolished the barricade of paws nead the jking - and more, as we shall see.</p>

<p><b>13 ... gxh6</b> Black must recapture the bishop, or be a pawn down without any positional compensation.</p>

<p><b>14 Qxh6</b>
