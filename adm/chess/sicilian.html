<h1>Sicilian defence</h1>

<p>A Sicilian priest named Pietro Carrera (1573–1647) published an analysis in 1617 of the opening moves <b>1.e4 c5</b>, and the opening has been called the Sicilian Defense ever since. By the middle of the 20th century, the Sicilian had become the most popular response to 1.e4. There’s no accounting for taste, but the opening is likely to retain its popularity, in part because there’s almost no end to the variety of positions that can emerge after the simple 1.e4 c5</p>

<p>The Sicilian is the most popular and best-scoring response to White's first move 1.e4. <br> 1.d4 is a statistically more successful opening for White due to the high success rate of the Sicilian defence against 1.e4. New In Chess stated in its 2000 Yearbook that of the games in its database, White scored 56.1% in 296,200 games beginning 1.d4, but 54.1% in 349,855 games beginning 1.e4, mainly due to the Sicilian, which held White to a 52.3% score in 145,996 games.</p>

<h2>General concepts</h2>

<p>By advancing the c-pawn two squares, Black asserts control over the d4-square and begins the fight for the centre of the board. White cannot put two pawns next to each other in the center. The move resembles 1…e5, the next most common response to 1.e4, in that respect. Unlike 1...e5, however, 1...c5 breaks the symmetry of the position, which strongly influences both players' future actions. White, having pushed a kingside pawn, tends to hold the initiative on that side of the board. Moreover, 1...c5 does little for Black's development, unlike moves such as 1...e5, 1...g6, or 1...Nc6, which either develop a minor piece or prepare to do so. In many variations of the Sicilian, Black makes a number of further pawn moves in the opening (for example, ...d6, ...e6, ...a6, and ...b5). Consequently, White often obtains a substantial lead in development and dangerous attacking chances.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, advancing a queenside pawn has given Black a spatial advantage there and provides a basis for future operations on that flank. Often, Black's c5-pawn is traded for White's d4-pawn in the early stages of the game, granting Black a central pawn majority. The pawn trade also opens the c-file for Black, who can place a rook or queen on that file to aid their queenside counterplay.</p>

<p>The Open Sicilian Defense is divided into four major variations based on Black’s response, although there are many other less-played options to be explored.</p>

<ul>

	<li><p>The Najdorf variation</p></li>
	<li><p>The <a href="dragon.html">Dragon variation</a></p></li>
	<li><p>The Classical variation</p></li>
	<li><p>The Scheveningen variation</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Open Sicilian: 2.Nf3 and 3.d4</h2>

<p>Over 75% of games beginning with 1.e4 c5 continue with 2.Nf3, after which there are three main options for Black: 2...d6, 2...Nc6, and 2...e6. Lines where White then plays 3.d4 are collectively known as the <b>Open Sicilian</b>, and result in extremely complex positions. White has a lead in development and extra kingside space, which White can use to begin a kingside attack. This is counterbalanced by Black's central pawn majority, created by the trade of White's d-pawn for Black's c-pawn, and the open c-file, which Black uses to generate queenside counterplay. </p>

<h3>2...d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3</h3>

<p>Black's most common move after 2.Nf3 is 2...d6. This prepares ...Nf6 to attack the e-pawn without letting White push it to e5. The game usually continues 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3. Black can then choose between four major variations: the <b>Najdorf</b> (5...a6), <b>Dragon</b> (5...g6), <b>Classical</b> (5...Nc6), and <b>Scheveningen</b> (5...e6). The rare Kupreichik Variation (5...Bd7) may transpose to one of the more common variations such as the Classical or Dragon, but it may also lead to a number of independent lines.</p>

<p>There are a few ways for either side to deviate from the sequence in the heading. After 3...cxd4, White occasionally plays 4.Qxd4, the Chekhover Variation, intending to meet 4...Nc6 with 5.Bb5 Bd7 6.Bxc6, when White hopes that their lead in development compensates for Black's bishop pair. Another unusual sideline is 3...cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.f3!?, the Prins Variation, which by delaying Nc3 maintains the option of setting up a Maróczy Bind formation with a later c2-c4. Black can avoid the Prins Variation by playing 3...Nf6, when 4.Nc3 cxd4 5.Nxd4 transposes to main lines. However, 3...Nf6 gives White an extra option in 4.dxc5!?, when Black can play either 4...Nxe4 or 4...Qa5+. </p>
