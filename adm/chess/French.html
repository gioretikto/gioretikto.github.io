<h1>French Defense</h1>

<p>The <b>French Defense</b> starts after <b>1.e4 e6</b>. Black's move by prepares the d7-d5 push to challenge White's center immediately. 1...e6 also opens lines for Black's dark-squared bishop and queen, an advantage over the Caro-Kann and Slav Defense (where Black also plays for the d7-d5 push). <br> The downside to 1...e6 is that Black imprisons their light-squared bishop, something that doesn't happen in the Caro or Slav. <br> The French Defense usually leads to closed, slow games, where piece maneuvering and pawn breaks are of the utmost importance.</p>

<p><b>Pros</b></p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Solid and sound structure;</p></li>
	<li><p>Sharp counterattacking possibilities;</p></li>
	<li><p>Easy to learn;</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Cons</b></p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Black has a space disadvantage;</p></li>
	<li><p>Black's light-squared bishop is locked in;</p></li>
	<li><p>Can become passive;</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Tarrasch Variation</h3>

<p>The <b>Tarrasch</b> is one of the most popular variations of the French, and it starts after <b>1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2</b>. White's 3.Nd2 avoids the pin on the knight after Black's common 3...Bb4 (Winawer Variation, discussed below). White opts for a more solid approach to face the French, aiming for a slight but safe advantage.</p>

<h3>Winawer Variation</h3>

<p>Another variation that enjoys much popularity, the Winawer starts with the moves <b>1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4</b>. Black plays for positional imbalances, usually exchanging the dark-squared bishop for the c3-knight. After that, White will have the choice of playing either a tactical or a more positional game. These are the trickiest and most tactical lines in the French Defense.</p>

<h3>Classical French</h3>

<p>The Classical French was the most popular way to respond to the French at the beginning of the 20th century. White would play for a strong center with the f2-f4 push, sometimes followed up by long castling and expansion on the kingside. The Classical French occurs after <b>1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5</b>.</p>

<h3>Advance Variation</h3>

<p>The game enters the Advance variation after the moves <b>1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5</b>. This line usually involves a positional struggle in closed positions, where White will try to play on the kingside, and Black will play on the queenside.</p>

<h3>Exchange Variation</h3>

<p>The Exchange Variation of the French happens after 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5. This continuation results in an equal position, giving this line the reputation of being drawish. In fact, most of the games do end in draws, with Black having a slight edge over White in decisive games.</p>
