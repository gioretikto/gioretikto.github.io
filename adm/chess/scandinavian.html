<h1>Scandinavian Defense </h1>

<p>The Scandinavian Defense, formerly better known in English language texts as the Center-Counter, is Black's seventh most popular response to 1.e4. The Scandinavian Defense is one of Black's more offbeat responses to White's 1.e4, where Black immediately attacks the white pawn with 1...d5. This is how it got its old name of the Center Counter, because Black immediately counters in the center.</p>

<p>Easily White's best response, and overwhelmingly its most popular, is to capture with 2.exd5. Although it is Black's first move that defines the Scandinavian, the position after that pawn capture is effectively the starting position for the opening. It's at this point where the Scandinavian really gets interesting.</p>

<p><b>Pros</b></p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Black opens the game immediately</p></li>
	<li><p>Usually both black bishops have freedom</p></li>
	<li><p>A provocative opening</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Cons</b></p>

<ul>
	<li><p>After the capture 2.exd5, Black loses time recapturing</p></li>
	<li><p>Because Black loses some time, he is in danger of a quick knockout</p></li>
	<li><p>White usually has more central space</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Variations</h3>

<p>Black has two main second moves: recapturing with 2...Qxd5, or playing 2...Nf6 planning to recapture with the knight. The former of these options breaks the rule, often taught to players just starting out, of not developing the queen too early.</p>

<h4>2...Qxd5</h4>

<p>White actually has several reasonable options here, but by far the most common is 3.Nc3, immediately asking Black why the queen exposed herself so soon. The temptation as Black on move three may be to check the white king down the e-file, but this is considered inferior to three main alternatives.</p>

<h4>3...Qa5</h4>

<p>The most common move for Black. Black often plays ...c6 to drop the queen back to c7 at some point, develops the light-squared bishop to f5 or g4 before playing a pawn to e6. The pawns on c6 and e6 create a solid structure for Black. However this is not the only way to play the position; see below how GM Viswanathan Anand treated the opening at the 1995 World Championship.</p>

<h4>3...Qd6</h4>

<p>This move only becomes more popular over time. It is generally more flexible than the other options and Black often obtains an imbalanced position including, if possible, queenside castling. The fact that White can play Nb5 to attack the queen again is not a big deal for Black because it wastes time for White as well.</p>

<h4>3...Qd8</h4>

<p>The oldest move, which is considered passive but playable. Black is just looking to return the queen to safety before setting up the same solid structure, with pawns on c6 and e6, as comes in the 3...Qa5 variations. Black also has the alternative of fianchettoing the dark-squared bishop with ...g6 and ...Bg7 instead of playing ...e6.</p>

<h2>2...Nf6</h2>

<p>If Black does not want to bring the queen out, this is the move to play. White can try to keep the pawn with 3.c4 or continue developing with either 3.Bb5+ or 3.d4. The tradeoff for Black is that while the queen does not come out early, the knight will have to move at least twice to regain the pawn.</p>
