<h1>Fianchetto</h1>

<p>Fianchetto is an Italian word which refers to a bishop development on the long diagonal, putting a bishop behind the knightâ€™s pawn. Fianchettos are made by advancing the pawns on the b- and g-files and developing the bishop behind the knight pawn.</p>

<h2>King's Fianchetto Opening<br>1.g3</h1>

<p>Sometimes called the Hungarian Opening, 1.g3 prepares to fianchetto the king's-bishop (Bg2), from which spot it will strike through the center. The delay of Nf3 leads to certain subtleties compared to the King's Indian attack.</p>
