<h1>Solventi deuterati in NMR</h1>
      
<p> There are two reasons for using deuterated solvents:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A modern NMR spectrometers measure the deuterium absorption of the solvent to stabilize the magnetic field strength. As the observation frequency is field dependent, the deuterium receiver notices a field fluctuation through a change of the observation frequency ("lock frequrency") and can correct the field strength correspondingly. You call this the <b>field/frequency lock</b>. In principle one could use other nuclei for the lock, as was done earlier (e. g. <sup>19</sup>F), but deuterium is the most convenient;</p></li>

<li><p>Another important factors to get a good quality NMR spectrum is <b>shimming</b>. NMR spectroscopy demands a homogeneous magnetic field over the whole of the sample volume located within the probe's detection coil.  If the field is not homogeneous the resulting spectra will suffer from distorted lineshape which in turn leads to poor resolution and sensitivity.  For this reason, the field has to be optimized to every sample that is introduced in the magnet. The process of adjusting the field's homogeneity is called “shimming”.  Shimming is achieved with the help of coils (shims) located at strategic places around the
sample in the magnet. By applying different electrical currents to these coils it is possible to compensate for deficiencies in the field homogeneity.  There can be from 12 to 32 or even more different shims depending on magnet design. These have names related to the axis of the field component they affect the most.  For routine operation it is usually necessary to shim only the first two or three Z shims (Z<sup>1</sup>,Z<sup>2</sup>, Z<sup>3</sup>).</p>

<p>To shim the magnet you will need an indicator of field homogeneity. This can be provided by the lock signal, whose intensity is proportional to the field's homogeneity. To shim, you make changes to the shims and observe the lock intensity. You continue making changes until a maximum intensity is reached.</p></li>

<li><p>As there is always much more solvent than substance of interest in the sample to be investigated, one uses a deuterated solvent instead of the ordinary <sup>1</sup>H-containing solvent to avoid the huge solvent absorption that would otherwise spoil the <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum.</li>

<p>The resonance frequency of a deuteron (<sup>2</sup>H) is very different from that of proton (<sup>1</sup>H), thus there is no interference.</p></li>
