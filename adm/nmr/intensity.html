<h1>Intensity</h1>

<p>The area under a peak in a NMR spectrum is proportional to the total number of nuclei giving rise to that signal; in other words the are of a peak can be used to gain information aboutthe concentration of the spin-active nuclei. In the absence of exchange, resonance lines are Lorentzian, and the proportionality with the concentration holds. All modern NMR spectrometer are capable of integrating peak areas, and the resulting integras can be plotted on the spectrum. In the case of a multiplet, the total area of the signal is integrated. By comparing integrals within a proton spectrum, it is possible to determine which signals are due to methyl (3 H), methhylene (2 H), or methine (1 H) groups. This is powerful aid in interpratation of proton spectra.</p>

<p>Because peak areas are proportional tothe concentrations of the spin-active nuclei, NMR can be used for quantitative analysis of molecules in solution. For quantitative analysis, analyte integrals are compared to integrals of an internal standard that is added to the sample at a known concentration. For hetenonuclear NMR (such as carbon) where broadband proton decoupling is used, the peak areas do not always give an accurate estimate of the concentration of spin-active nuclei. Decoupling gives rise to NOE that complicate the interpretation of integral areas.</p>
