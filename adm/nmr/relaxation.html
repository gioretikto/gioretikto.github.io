<h1>Relaxation</h1>

<p>It can be shown that the spontaneous radiative decay times increase with the inverse third power of the transition frequency and, in NMR transitions, they may reach values as large as 10<sup>8</sup> s (years). This fact, together with the fact that the energy gap between spin levels is such that, at thermal equilibrium, the population ratio between the states involved in the transitions is practically equal to 1, would imply an almost instantaneous saturation, where the energy-level populations become equal to each
other. Consequently, being the emission and absorption probabilities equal to each other, there would be no change in the radiation intensity, i-e., it would not be registered any spectrum.</p>

<p>The existence of <b>nonradiative relaxation mechanisms</b>, with decay times much shorter than radiative ones, allows us to maintain a difference between the state populations and, consequently, allows intensity variations in the radiation as sufficiently appreciable to produce a NMR spectrum. Moreover, the origin of these nonradiative relaxation mechanisms arises from he interactions of a spin with its chemical environment which, as said, are the major cause of the line broadening. Thus the importance of relaxation mechanisms in NMR spectroscopy is clear: By studying the linewidth and intensity of the peaks of a spectrum, further information on the chemical environment around the spin involved in each transition, i.e., further structural information on the molecule, may be obtained.</p>

<h2>Spin-lactice relaxation</h2>

<p>Immediately after pulse excitation of nuclear spins, the bulk magnetisation vector is moved away from the thermal equilibrium +<i>z</i> axis, which corresponds to a change in the spin populations. The recovery of the magnetisation along the <i>z</i> axis, termed longitudinal relaxation, therefore corresponds to the equilibrium populations being re-established, and hence to an overall loss of energy of the spins. The energy lost by the spins is transferred into the surroundings in the form of heat, although the energies involved are so small that temperature changes in the bulk sample are undetectable. This gives rise to the original term for this process as spin-lattice relaxation, which originated in the early days of solid-state NMR where the excess energy was described as dissipating into the surrounding rigid lattice.</p>

<p>The Bloch theory of NMR assumes that the recovery of the +<i>z</i>-magnetisation, <i>M<sub>z</sub></i>, follows exponential behaviour, described by:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>d<i>M<sub>z</sub></i>/ d<i>t</i> = (<i>M<sub>0</sub></i> − <i>M<sub>z</sub></i>)/<i>T<sub>1</sub></i></p>
</div>

<p>where <i>M<sub>0</sub></i> is the magnetisation at thermal equilibrium and <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> is the (first-order) time
constant for this process.</p>

<p>The nucleus cannot simply transfer energy to molecular motions (vibration, rotation, translation, etc.) by collisions because the nucleus is not really “attached” to the rest of the molecule. The tiny nucleus sits in a vacuum very far from the bonding electrons that hold the molecule together, and its only mechanism for interaction with the outside world is through its magnetic properties. Thus only magnetic fields can affect the nucleus and induce transitions from the β to the α state (longitudinal relaxation) or create random differences in the rate of precession (transverse relaxation).</p>

<p>Recall that the fundamental requirement for inducing nuclear spin transitions, and hence restoring equilibrium populations in this case, is a magnetic field oscillating at the Larmor frequency of the spins, and the long relaxation times suggests such suitable fields are not in great abundance. Relaxations is induced by an external fluctuating field, coming from neighbouing protons or other nuclei or molecules, which have magnetic moments. Molecules have a range of motional frequencies, so the magnetic moments of these molecules will also have a frequency distribution. In order to induce the transition needed for <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> relaxation, the fluctuactions have to be at the Larmor frequency, in the same way that the external <i>B<sub>1</sub></i> fields has to oscillate at the Larmor frequency.</p>

<p>Several prcesses, both within the molecule (intramolecular) and between molecules (intermolecular), contribute to spin-lattine relaxation. The principal contributor is dipole-dipole interaction. The spin of an excited nucleus interacts with the spins of other magnetic nuclei that are in the same molecule or in nearby molecules. These interactions can induce nuclear spin transitions and exchange. For carbon nuclei, relaxation is fastest if hydrogen atoms are directly bondend.</p>

<p>Therefore <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> is an indicator of how rapidly a nuclear spin is.</p>

<p>The spin-lattice relaxation time <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> governs the rate of this process.</p>

<p>Spin–lattice relaxation is also most effective in larger molecules, which tumble (rotate) slowly, and it is very inefficient 
in small molecules, which tumble faster.</p>

<p>For medium-sized organic molecules (those with a mass of a few hundred), proton <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> s tend to fall in the range 0.5–5 s, whereas carbon <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> s tend to range from a few seconds to many tens of seconds. For spins to relax fully after a 90° pulse, it is necessary to wait a period of at least 5<i>T<sub>1</sub></i> (at which point magnetisation has recovered by 99.33%) and thus it may be necessary to wait many minutes for full recovery.</p>

<p>Our interesent is in spin-lattice relation times <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> as they relate to the intensity of NMR signals and have other implications relevant to structure determination.</p>
