<h1>The probe</h1>

<p>The probe where the sample sits is introduced into the magnet from the bottom and contains the RF coils, which creates the <i>B<sub>1</sub></i> field for the <sup>1</sup>H- and X-nucleus, and the <sup>2</sup>H lock. Also, the probe detects the transverse magnetisation as it precesses in the (<i>xy</i>) plane. RF coils can be divided into three general categories; transmit and receive coils, receive only coils, and transmit only coils. Modern NMR spectrometers are equipped with transmit and receive coils that
serve as the transmitter of the <i>B<sub>1</sub></i>, fields and receiver of RF energy from the relaxed nuclei.</p>
