<h1>Transverse Relaxation: loss of magnetisation in the x–y plane</h1>

<p>Referring back to the situation immediately following a 90° pulse in which the transverse magnetisation is on-resonance in the rotating frame, there exists another way in which observable magnetisation can be lost. Recall that the bulk magnetisation vector results from the addition of many microscopic vectors for the individual nuclei that are said to possess phase coherence following the pulse. In a sample of like spins, one would anticipate that these would remain static in the rotating frame, perfectly aligned along the y axis (ignoring the effects of longitudinal relaxation). However, this only holds if the magnetic field experienced by each spin in the sample is exactly the same. If this is not the case, some spins will experience a slightly greater local field than the mean causing them to have a higher frequency and to creep ahead, whereas others will experience a slightly smaller field and start to lag behind. This results in a fanning-out of the individual magnetisation vectors, which ultimately leads to no net magnetisation in the transverse plane (Fig. 2.24). This is another form of relaxation referred to as transverse relaxation, which is again assumed to occur with an exponential decay now characterised by the time constant <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>. Magnetic field differences in the sample can be considered to arise from two distinct sources. The first is simply from static magnetic field inhomogeneity throughout the sample volume, which is really an instrumental imperfection and it is this one aims to minimise for each sample when optimising or ‘shimming’ the static magnetic field. The second is from the local magnetic fields arising from intramolecular and intermolecular interactions in the sample, which represent ‘genuine’ or ‘natural’ transverse relaxation processes. The relaxation time constant for the two sources combined is designated <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>* such that:</p>

<p>1/<i>T<sub>2</sub></i>* = 1/<i>T<sub>2</sub></i> + 1/T<sub>2(&Delta;B<sub>0</sub>)</sub></p>


<p>where <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> refers to contribution from genuine relaxation processes and <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> to that from field
inhomogeneity. The decay of transverse magnetisation is manifested in the observed FID. Moreover, the widths of NMR resonances are inversely proportional to <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>* since a short <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>* corresponds to a faster blurring of the transverse magnetisation, which in turn corresponds to a greater frequency difference between the vectors and thus a greater spread (broader line) in the frequency dimension (Fig. 2.25). For (single) exponential relaxation, the line-shape is Lorentzian with a half-height linewidth, &Delta;&nu;<sub>1/2</sub> (Fig. 2.26) of</p>

<p>&Delta;&nu;<sub>1/2</sub> = 1/&pi; <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>*</p>

<p>For most spin-1⁄2 nuclei in small, rapidly tumbling molecules in low-viscosity solutions, it is field homogeneity that provides the dominant contribution to observed linewidths, and it is rarely possible to obtain genuine <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> measurements directly from these. However, nuclei with spin &gt;1⁄2 (<a href="quadrupolar.html">quadrupolar nuclei</a>) may be relaxed very efficiently by interactions with local electric field gradients and so have broad lines and short <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>s that can be determined directly from linewidths. Generally speaking, relaxation mechanisms that operate to restore longitudinal magnetisation also act to destroy transverse magnetisation, and since there clearly can be no magnetisation remaining in the x–y plane when it has all returned to the +z axis, <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> can never be longer than T<sub>1</sub>. However, additional mechanisms may also operate to reduce <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>, so that it may be shorter. Again, for most spin-1⁄2 nuclei in small, rapidly tumbling molecules, T<sub>1</sub> and <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> have the same value, whilst for large molecules that tumble slowly in solution or for solids <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> is often very much shorter than T<sub>1</sub> (see Section 2.5). Whereas longitudinal relaxation causes a loss of energy from the spins, transverse relaxation occurs by a <b>mutual swapping of energy between spins</b>, for example, one spin being excited to the &beta; state while another simultaneously drops to the &alpha; state – a so-called flip-flop process. This gives rise to the original term of <b>spin–spin relaxation</b>, which is still in widespread use. Longitudinal relaxation is thus an <b>enthalpic</b> process whereas transverse relaxation is <b>entropic</b>. Although the measurement of <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> has far less significance in routine spectroscopy, methods for this are described below for completeness,
 and an alternative practical use of these is also presented.</p>

<h2>Mechanisms for transverse relaxation</h2>

<p>Dephasing, or loss of coherence between the spins, occurs by three main mechanisms</p>

<ol>

	<li><p>The first process that contributes to dephasing is an <b>inhomogeneous magnetic field</b>. This inhomogeneity causes the precessional frequency of the spins to differ from location to location within the sample. The different precessional frequencies lead to dephasing of the magnetization while the data is being collected. This relaxation mechanism clearly has nothing to do with the intrinsic properties of the molecules in the sample and is thus an annoyance. Fortunately, the contribution of magnetic field inhomogeneities to the relaxation rate is quite small in modern superconducting magnets, less than 1 sec<sup>−1</sup>, provided the magnet is <a href="shimming.html">shimmed</a> correctly. Consequently this mechanism can be ignored in studies on high molecular weight molecules.</p></li>
	
	<li><p>The second process that contributes to dephasing of the transverse magnetization arises from <b>dipolar coupling between magnetic dipoles</b>. Consequently, this process is often referred to as spin-spin relaxation. The rate constant for this relaxation
process is <i>R<sub>2</sub><sup>DD</sup></i>. This mechanism of relaxation is sensitive to molecular motion and plays a dominate role in the relaxation of most spin-1/2 nuclei. For <sup>1</sup>H in molecules dissolved in aqueous solutions, since most of the nuclei are exposed to the solvent. On the other hand, <sup>13</sup>C spins are normally in the interior of the molecule and the relaxation is dominated by intramolecular <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C DD interactions.</p></li>

	<li><p>The third process that contributes to relaxation is an anisotropic electron density surrounding the nucleus. This is referred to as <b>Chemical Shift Anisotropy (CSA)</b> and will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 19. The rate constant for this
. This relaxation mechanism is important for nuclei in anisotropic process is R<sub>2</sub><sup>CSA</sup> bonding environments, such as carbon and nitrogen, and is also sensitive to molecular motion.</p></li>
