<h1>NMR of Paramagnetic Molecules</h1>

<p>NMR is a powerful tool fot the investigation of complexes of organic molecules with paramagnetic metal ions in solutions- The method gives information about the structure of complex, the nature of metal-ligand bond, the reorientation time of complexes, the residence time of molecules in the solvatation sphere, etc.; (c) a strong temperature dependence of the position and width of the resonance lines.</p>    

<p>A large number of metalloproteins carry paramagnetic ions. The most common naturally occuring metal ions are Fe in its various oxidation states Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. While former three are paramagnetic, Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, have been conveniently studie both in thei diamagnetic form and by substituiting these ions by paramagnetic Co<sup>2+</sup>.</p>


<p>NMR spectra of paramagnetic systems are characterized by a very large shifts caused by an interaction ewith the magnetic moment of the unpaired electrons - the measured <sup>1</sup>H shifts are, for example, of the order of some 100 ppm, in comparison with about 10 ppm in diamagnetic system; (b) a strong line-broadening due to dipolar and/or scalar electron-nucleus interatction; (c) a strong temperature dependence of the position and width of the resonances lines.</p>
