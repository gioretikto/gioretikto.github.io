<h1>Field-Lock</h1>

<p>After obtaining a satisfactory homogeneity using the shim coils, the next step is to secure the stability of the homogeneous field. The field strength might vary over time due to the magnet aging, and for a new magnet owing to the movement of metal objects near the magnet, or temperature fluctuations. Stabilisation is achieved by the so-called field-lock. It could be said that the field
lock system is a self-contained mini-NMR spectrometer within the spectrometer, which measures most often the resonance position of deuterium. The deuterium signal comes from the deuterium solvent used to prepare the sample. The frequency of the lock transmitter is swept over a range of about 1 MHz as it searches for the resonance frequency of deuterium. When it first detects a resonant response, it stores this value and then jumps to a higher frequency and approaches resonance from the other direction. When it detects a resonance response as it approaches from the other direction, it stores this frequency and then jumps to a frequency at the midpoint between the two stored values and then ‘locks’ on this frequency as the resonance frequency of deuterium. Any drift from this resonance frequency, caused by field inhomogeneities, is corrected by minor changes in the <i>B<sub>0</sub></i> magnetic field to keep the resonance frequency constant.</p>
