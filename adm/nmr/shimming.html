<h1>Shim Coils</h1>

<p>For high-resolution NMR spectroscopy, the magnetic field homogeneity should be adjusted to better than 1 ppb (part per billion) over the sample volume. Minor spatial inhomogeneities may be created by the magnet design, variations in the thickness of the sample tube, sample permeability, and ferromagnetic materials around the magnet.</p>

<p>The homogeneity requirements are usually lower for MRI. The homogeneity of the magnetic field created by the magnet is adjusted by using a set of shim coils. Superconducting magnets usually have at least eight superconducting shim coils placed symmetrically to the centre of the main coil, and can be mounted either on the outside of the coil, between two sections of the main coil, or inside the innermost section of the coil. Simplest is a placement on the outside, although this placement requires shim coils with a larger number of windings. The Cartesian coordinate description of the gradients is normally used to name the shim coils. They are named after the mathematical function of the field that they supply. The basic ones are somewhat obviously called 'X','Y' and 'Z'. That is, they have a linear effect on the field in the X,Y and Z directions. The more complex shape ones have esoteric names such as X2Y2Z4 (X<sup>2</sup>Y<sup>2</sup>Z<sup>4</sup>).</p>

<p>Shimming is obtained by passing the appropriate amount of current through each shim coil until a homogeneous magnetic field is achieved. The optimum shim current settings are found either by minimising the line width, maximising the size of the FID, or maximising the signal from the field lock. On most spectrometers, the shim coils are manageable by the computer by means of an appropriate algorithm, whose task is to find the best shim value by maximising the lock signal.</p>

<p>Shimming is normally carried out by maximizing the amplitude of the detected <sup>2</sup>H signal in the lock channel. Because the number of <sup>2</sup>H’s in the scanned region is constant, the area of the <sup>2</sup>H signal from the solvent is also constant as long as we do not apply too much RF power that is tuned to the <sup>2</sup>H Larmor frequency.</p>

<p>By maximizing the amplitude of the signal in the lock channel through adjustment of the various shims, the width of the range of the <sup>2</sup>H solvent resonance is minimized. Imagine that the peak from the solvent is a triangle (it is probably a Lorentzian peak, but a triangle is close enough for right now). If the area of a triangle is constant, reducing the width of the triangle must necessarily increase the height of the triangle. The width of the roughly triangular solvent resonance at half-height represents the range of frequencies being detected from the <sup>2</sup>H’s in the solvent of the sample. The narrower the range of frequencies, the more homogeneous (even) is the field. If we have a range of <strong>B<sub>0</sub></strong>’s being felt by the solvent molecules, the energy gap ΔE between the allowed spin states will also exhibit a range of values.</p>

<p>While conceptually this is a simple task, in reality it is complicated by the fact that most shims interact with others. In other words, having made changes to one it will then be necessary to re-optimise those with which it interacts. Fortunately, shims do not influence all others, but can be subdivided into smaller groups which are dealt with sequentially during the shimming process.</p>
