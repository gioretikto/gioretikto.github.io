<h1>Scalar Coupling</h1>

<p>A single nucleus, e.g. a proton, yields one defined resonance in an NMR spectrum, with the spectral position depending on its electronic environment. In a larger molecule, this nucleus (nucleus 1) is bonded to other nuclei by bonding electrons, and these nuclei affect the local magnetic field experienced by nucleus 1. The spin of a bonded nucleus 2 can assume two different orientations. Depending on the orientation of spin 2, nucleus 1 has two slightly different Larmor frequencies, and two resonances for nucleus 1 will be detected in an NMR experiment. This phenomenon is called <b>scalar</b> or <b>J-coupling</b>. The split resonance from <i>J</i>-coupling is called a <i>doublet</i>. The separation of the two resonances (measured in Hz) is called the <i>J-coupling constant</i>.</p>

<figcaption>When two nuclei 1 and 2 are connected by chemical bonds, the orientation of the magnetic moment of nucleus 2 (blue) is experienced by nucleus 1 (yellow), and influences the energy levels of nucleus 1. Coupling of nucleus 1 to nucleus 2 splits the single resonance of nucleus 1 into two resonances of equal intensity, corresponding to transitions of nucleus 1 with the spin of nucleus 2 in either of the two possible orientations.</figcaption>

<p>In NMR spectroscopy, <i>J</i>-coupling through up to three bonds is typically analyzed. The <i>Karplus equation</i> relates the value of <i>J</i> for two nuclei coupled through three bonds to the dihedral angle &phi; that is defined by the bonds</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>J</i> = <i>a</i>cos<sup>2</sup> &phi; + <i>b</i> cos &phi; + <i>c</i></p>
</div>

<p>The constants <i>a,b</i>, and <i>c</i> depend on the nuclei and the connecting bonds. <i>J</i>-coupling constants are between 0.1 and 10 Hz for protons, but can exceed theese values for other nuclei. </p>

<p><b>Note</b>. The terms <b>vicinal angle</b> and <b>dihedral angle</b> &phi; mean the same thing, but NMR spectroscopists tend to say vicinal.</p>

<p>Scalar coupling arises from the interaction of the nuclear magnetic moment with the electrons involved in the chemical bond. The nuclear spin polarization of one atom affects the polarization of the surrounding electrons. The electron polarization subsequently produces a change in the magnetic field that is sensed by the coupled spin. For example, consider a C-H group in a molecule, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The proton nuclear spin polarizes the electron in the σ bonding orbital. This polarization alters the magnetic field at the carbon nucleus. Since there are two possible spin states for the proton magnetic dipole, the effective field at the carbon nucleus is increased or decreased, depending on the spin state of the attached proton. Since the population
differences between the two orientations of the proton spin are approximately equal, one-half of the attached carbons will experience an increase in the local magnetic field while the other half will experience a decrease. This difference in the local magnetic field at the carbon nucleus will lead to a shift of the carbon resonance frequency. Since there are two possible proton spin states, the carbon spectrum is split into two lines, with the separation between the lines equal to the J-coupling.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig.1</b>-Nuclear spin coupling in a <sup>13</sup>C-H group. Two C-H groups in separate, but otherwise identical molecules, are shown. The two molecules differ only in the spin state of the proton. The bonding electrons in the σ orbital become polarized from the proton mag- netic dipole, as indicated by the oval field lines. The polarization of the electrons can either increase or decrease the magnetic field at the <sup>13</sup>C nucleus, depending on the proton spin state. One orientation of the proton spin increases the magnetic field (upper molecule), while the other orientation causes a decrease in the apparent field (lower molecule), causing either an upfield or downfield shift in the resonance line, depending on the spin-state of the attached proton. The observed carbon spectrum is the sum of these two resonances, giving two peaks that are separated by the J-coupling constant, as shown in the middle spectrum.</p>

<p>The change in the magnetic field induced by the proton spins is proportional to γ<sub>H</sub>. The corresponding change in the carbon resonance frequency is proportional to the product of this field change and the gyromagnetic ratio of the carbon spin, i.e.: </p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&Delta;&omega; &prop; γ<sub>H</sub>γ<sub>C</sub></i></p>
</div>

<p>The effect of the carbon spin on the proton spin is calculated in the same way. The change in the local magnetic field at the proton nucleus is proportional to ±γ<sub>C</sub>, giving rise to a frequency shift of the protons of ±<i>γ<sub>C</sub>γ<sub>H</sub></i>. Consequently, the proton spin will experience exactly the same shift in frequency as its coupled partner, giving rise to exactly the same splitting of the proton resonance line as the resonance line from the attached carbon. Also note that the observed frequency shift only depends on the product of the gyromagnetic ratios of the coupled spins; the <b>scalar coupling constant is independent of the applied magnetic field</b> (<i>B<sub>0</sub></i>). Values of J-coupling constants that are important in biomolecular NMR are shown in Table 7.1. The strength of the J-coupling depends on several factors, including the gyromagnetic ratio of the coupled spins, the number of bonds connecting the coupled spins, and the conformation of the intervening bonds in the case of multiple bond couplings. The series of single bond heteronuclear couplings (Table 7.1, left column) illustrates the effect of the gyromagnetic ratio on the coupling constant; the coupling constant increases with increasing γ.</p>

<p>Scalar coupling through multiple bonds greatly attenuates the coupling. For example, the strong single bond H-C coupling of 130 Hz is reduced to 5 Hz when an additional carbon-carbon bond is inserted between the two coupled spins (Table 7.1). In the case of multiple bond couplings, the conformation of the coupled atoms affects the coupling constant. For example, the three bond proton-proton coupling in the H-C-C-H group ranges from 2 to 14 Hz. The relationship between the coupling constant and the torsional angle is represented by the Karplus relationship:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>J = Acos<sup>2</sup> θ + Bcosθ + C</i></p>
</div>

<p>where A, B, and C are empirical constants. For example, the φ angle in the peptide bond affects the strength of the coupling between the amide proton and the alpha proton, as illustrated in Fig. 7.2.</p>

<h2>Coupling to Multiple Spins</h2>

<p>The coupling between a carbon and a hydrogen in a <sup>13</sup>C-H group results in the splitting of both the proton and carbon spectral line by an amount J<sub>CH</sub> Hz. If the carbon atom is coupled to more than one equivalent proton 1 , such as in a <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>2</sub> or <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub> group, then a more complex splitting pattern is observed. In the case of a <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>2</sub> group a triplet of lines is observed in the carbon NMR spectrum, as illustrated in Fig. 7.3. This pattern arises because there are four possible combinations of the spin-states of the two coupled protons and the local magnetic field at the carbon nucleus will be the sum of the field changes induced by each proton. When the magnetic moment of both protons point upwards, in the direction of <i>B<sub>0</sub></i>, the frequency shift of the resonance line will be 2 × J/2 Hz, or J Hz. When the proton spins are both pointing in the opposite direction the shift is −J Hz. When the direction of the proton spins are opposite to each other, the local fields at the carbon cancel, resulting in a zero frequency shift of the carbon spin. The intensity of the lines in the carbon spectrum is proportional to the number of molecules in the sample having one of the four possible proton spin-states. Since the state in which the proton spins point in opposing directions occurs twice as frequently as the other two states, the central line of the triplet will have twice the intensity of the outer lines, giving an observed intensity ratio of 1:2:1, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The coupling between a carbon atom and three equivalent protons, such as in a methyl group (<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>), can be analyzed in exactly the same way.</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig.1</b>. Scalar coupling to multiple equivalent protons. The effect of scalar coupling to two (A) or three (B) equivalent protons on the carbon spectrum is shown. The possible arrangements of two (labeled A B) or three protons (labeled A B C) are shown in the upper part of each panel (<sup>1</sup>H spin-states). The resultant shift in the frequency of the attached carbon is indicated by ∆ν. The final carbon spectrum is shown in the lower part of each panel. In both cases the splitting, or separation between the lines, is equal to <sup>1</sup>J<sub>CH</sub>. The intensity of each line depends on the number of molecules in the sample with a particular spin state; a 1:2:1 ratio will be found for two coupled protons and a 1:3:3:1 ratio is found for three coupled protons.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The change in the local field that occurs when the magnetic dipoles from all of the protons are aligned in the same direction is ± 3/2 J. When the magnetic dipoles of two protons are oriented in the same direction, while the third is pointing in the opposite direction, the frequency shift is ±1/2 J since the opposing pairs cancel each other’s effect on the local magnetic field at the carbon nucleus. Again, the relative intensity of each line is proportional to the number of atoms that give a particular frequency shift, in this case the four lines in the quartet will have a relative intensities of 1:3:3:1. Homonuclear, proton-proton, couplings are analyzed in a similar way. For example, consider the NMR spectrum of ethanol, shown in Fig. 2.6. In this example, all of the carbons are <sup>12</sup>C and are therefore NMR inactive. The two CH<sub>2</sub> protons are split into a quartet by the three equivalent methyl protons. Likewise, the three methyl protons are split into a triplet due to coupling to the two equivalent CH<sub>2</sub> protons. The effect of coupling to multiple spins on an NMR spectral line can be easily obtained from Pascal’s triangle, each row of the triangle indicates the location of each line in the multiplet as well as the relative intensity of the line. In cases where an atom is coupled to two different, or non-equivalent, spins, then the couplings are treated independently. For example, the carbonyl carbon is coupled to both the amide nitrogen (<sup>1</sup>J<sub>NC</sub> ≈ 12 Hz) as well as the alpha carbon, (<sup>1</sup>J<sub>C'C<sub>α</sub></sub> ≈ 55 Hz), consequently the spectra line from the carbonyl will be a quartet, showing both couplings (see Fig. 2).</p>

<figcaption><b>Fig.2</b>. Scalar coupling to nonequivalent spins. The spectrum of a carbonyl carbon is shown. A quartet is observed because the coupling to the alpha carbon (J<sub>C'C<sub>α</sub></sub> is larger than the two bond coupling to the nitrogen (J N C ). The spin-states of the C α carbon and nitrogen are shown below the spectrum. Since these four states are equally likely, the ratio of the intensities of the lines in the quartet are 1:1:1:1.</ficaption>
