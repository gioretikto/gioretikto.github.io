<h1>Pulse</h1>

<p>The next step of the experiment, the application of the <i>B<sub>1</sub></i> pulse, has to be considered. Assuming that the <i>B<sub>1</sub></i> magnetic field oscillates in y-direction, it can be described as:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>B<sub>1</sub></i> = |<i>b<sub>1</sub></i>| cos(<i>ωt</i>)ĵ</p>
</div>

<p>where <i>b<sub>1</sub></i> is the amplitude of the applied field, ω is its frequency, and ĵ describes its direction.</p>

<p>All three of these parameters; intensity, frequency, and direction, are under computer control in modern NMR instruments. The 
<i>B<sub>1</sub></i> field of the trasmitter is 1-40 mT.</p>

<p>When RF power is applied to the coil wound along the x-axis, the result is a magnetic field which oscillates along the <i>x</i>-axis. What we mean by this is that the magnetic field starts out pointing along +<i>x</i>, gradually shrinks to zero and then increases along the –x direction. It then shrinks back to zero and finally increases back to its original value along +<i>x</i>. We will take the frequency of this oscillation to be <i>ω<sub>tx</sub></i> (in rad s<sup>–1</sup>) (‘tx’ is the traditional abbreviation for transmitter) and the size of the magnetic field to be 2B<sub>1</sub>; the reason for the 2 will become apparent later. <i>ω<sub>tx</sub></i> is called the transmitter frequency for the reason that an RF transmitter is used to produce the power. It turns out to be a lot easier to work out the effect of this oscillating field if we replace it, in our minds, with two counter-rotating fields, as is illustrated in Fig. 1. The two counter-rotating fields have the same magnitude <i>B<sub>1</sub></i>. One, denoted <i>B<sub>1</sub></i><sup>+</sup></i>, rotates in the positive sense (from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i>) and the other, denoted <i>B<sub>1</sub><sup>–</sup></i>, rotates in the negative sense; both are rotating at the transmitter frequency <i>ω<sub>tx</sub></i>.</p>

give a field which is oscillating along the x-axis, shown in (b). The graph shows how the field along x varies with time.</figcaption>

<p>Supposing we are dealing with a nucleus with a positive gyromagnetic ratio; recall that this means the Larmor frequency is negative so that the sense of precession is clockwise from <i>x</i> towards –<i>y</i>, which is the same direction as the rotation of <i>B<sub>1</sub><sup>–</sup></i>. It turns out that the other field, <i>B<sub>1</sub></i><sup>+</sup></i>, which is rotating in the opposite sense to the Larmor precession, has no significant interaction with the magnetization and so we will ignore it.</p>

<h2>Rotating Frame</h2>

<p>Note that if &omega;<sub>R</sub> = 0 the rotating and laboratory frames are indistinguishable. In the rotating frame of reference, the angular rate of precession of the moment, appears to be reduced. This difference frequency is called the <i>offset</i>, and is given the symbol Ω:</p>
 
<div class="eq">
<p><i>Ω = &omega;<sub>0</sub> - &omega;<sub>rot</sub></i></p>
</div>

<p>In other words, this apparent precesssion frequency Ω corresponds to a Larmor frequency arising from a <i>reduced field</i>,  <i>&Delta;B</i> along O<sub>z'</sub>. in the rotating frame O<sub>x',y',z'</sub>, given by</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>Ω = &omega;<sub>0</sub> - &omega;<sub>rot</sub> = -&gamma;</i> (<i>B<sub>0</sub> + &omega;<sub>rot</sub>/&gamma;</i>) = -<i>&gamma;&Delta;B</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>When RF power is applied it provides the field B<sun>1</sub> such that <i>B<sub>1</sub> &lt;&lt; B<sub>0</sub></i>, and applied along the <i>x'</i> direction of the rotating frame. The RF field which if we choose ω<sub>rot. frame</sub> = –ω<sub>tx</sub>, gives rise to a static field <i>B<sub>1</sub></i> along the <i>x'</i>-axis.</p>

<p>The vector sum of the reduced field Δ<i>B</i> and the <i>B<sub>1</sub></i> field, is equal to the <i>effective field</i>, <i>B<sub>eff</sub></i>. The <i>tilt angle</i>, <i>θ</i>, is defined as the angle between <i>B<sub>eff</sub></i> and Δ<i>B</i>.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>B<sub>eff</sub></i> = (ΔB + B<sub>1</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup></p>
</div>

<p>The crucial point is that the magnetization precesses around the effective field, just as in the laboratory frame the Larmor precession takes place around the <i>B<sub>0</sub></i> field. As usual, the precessional frequency about the effective field ω eff is proportional to the field:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&omega;<sub>eff</sub></i> = |<i>&gamma;</i>| <i>B<sub>eff</sub></i></p>
</div>

<p>We are taking the absolute value of the quantity they enclose i.e. ignore the sign. Thus, regardless of the sign of γ, ω<sub>eff</sub> is always positive. If the offset is small the effective field will lie close to the x'-axis, and so the equilibrium 
magnetization will be rotated away from the z-axis, which is exactly what we want to achieve. The key point is that, although <i>B<sub>0</sub></i> is very much larger than <i>B<sub>1</sub></i> , we can eliminate the effect of the <i>B<sub>0</sub></i> field by setting the transmitter frequency close to the Larmor frequency i.e. by making the offset small. With this condition the reduced field Δ<i>B</i> is small and it is then possible for the small B 1 field to begin to exert an influence. In the limit that the offset is zero, Δ<i>B</i> disappears and the <i>B<sub>1</sub></i> field is the only one left in the rotating frame.</p>
