<p>There are a number of different experiments devised for the determination of the longitudinal relaxation times of nuclear spins, and only the most commonly applied method, inversion recovery, will be considered here. The full procedure is described first, followed by the ‘quick-and-dirty’ approach that is handy for experimental set-up. In essence, all one needs to do to determine T<sub>1</sub>s is to perturb a spin system from thermal equilibrium and then devise some means of following its recovery as a function of time. The inversion recovery experiment is a simple two-pulse sequence (Fig. 2.21) that, as the name implies, creates the initial population disturbance by <i>inverting</i> the spin populations through the application a 180° pulse. The magnetisation vector, initially aligned with the -z axis, will gradually shrink back toward the x–y plane, pass through this and eventually make a full recovery along the þz axis at a rate dictated by the quantity of interest, T<sub>1</sub>. Since magnetisation along the z axis is unobservable, the recovery is monitored by placing the vector back in the x–y plane with a 90° pulse after a suitable period, &tau;, following the initial inversion (Fig. 2.22). If &tau; is zero, the magnetisation vector terminates with full intensity along the +y axis producing an inverted spectrum using conventional spectrum phasing, that is, defining the þy axis to represent positive absorption. Repeating the experiment with increasing values of &tau; allows one to follow the relaxation of the spins in question (Fig. 2.23). Finally, when &tau; is sufficiently long (&tau;<sub>∞</sub> &gt; 5T<sub>1</sub>), complete relaxation will occur between the two pulses and the maximum positive signal is recorded. The intensity of the detected magnetisation, M<sub>t</sub>, follows:</p>






<p>where M<sub>0</sub> corresponds to equilibrium magnetisation, such as that recorded at &tau;<sub>∞</sub>. Note here the additional factor of two relative to Eq. (2.8) as the recovery starts from inverted magnetisation. The relaxation time is determined by fitting the signal intensities to this equation, algorithms for which are found in many NMR software packages. The alternative traditional method of extracting T<sub>1</sub> from such an equation is to analyse a semi-logarithmic plot of ln(M<sub>0</sub> - M<sub>t</sub>) versus &tau; whose slope is 1/T<sub>1</sub>. The most likely causes of error in the use of the inversion recovery method are inaccurate recording of M<sub>0</sub> if full equilibration is not achieved and inaccuracies in the 180&tau; pulse causing imperfect initial inversion. The scaling factor (2 in Eq. (2.9)) can be made variable in fitting routines to allow for incomplete
inversion.</p>
