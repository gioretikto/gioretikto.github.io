<h1>Chemical Shielding</h1>

<p>A very important feature of NMR spectroscopy is that the absorption frequency of a nuclear spin depends on the magnetic field strength at the nucleus. This magnetic field usually differs slightly from the applied field, <i>B<sub>0</sub></i>, because electrons that surround the nucleus are not impassive in the magnetic field but react to produce a secondary magnetic fields. This secondary magnetic field. This secondardy magnetic field contributes to the total fieldf felt at the nucleus, and therefore has the potential to change the resonance frequency of the nucleus. This interaction of the secondary field produced by the electron is the <i>shielding interaction</i>. The frequency shift that this interaction casuses in an NMR spectrum is the <i>chemical shift</i> This shielding is due to precession of electrons under the influence of the applied magnetic field. This precession generates an additional magnetic field that usually opposes the externally applied magnetic field.</p>

<p>The shielding interaction may be considered as being composed of two components:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>The external magnetic field causes all electrons to circulate around it. This produces a secondary field which opposes the applied field at the centre of motion. Hence, this field tends to shield the nucleus. This is known as the diamagnetic contribution to the shielding. This contribution varies as <i>r<sup>–3</sup></i> where <i>r<sub>i</sub></i> is the distance of the ith electron from the nucleus. Hence, it arises principally from the core electrons. This means that the diamagnetic shielding arising from an atom in a molecule is fairly constant for a given atom type, whatever its environment. However, it should be noted that all atoms surrounding the atom in question also generate diamagnetic electron currents, and so also contribute to the total diamagnetic field felt at the nucleus.</p></li>

	<li><p>The external magnetic field may also mix excited electronic states that possess paramagnetic properties with the ground state, creating a small amount of paramagnetism in the ground state of the molecule while it is in the magnetic field. This creates a field which supports the applied field at the nucleus, and so tends to deshield the nucleus. This is known as the paramagnetic contribution and varies considerably with the nuclear environment. The degree of mixing of the excited paramagnetic states with the ground state depends on the energy difference between the mixed states, and is known as Temperature Independent Paramagnetism (TIP).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As the electron density around the nucleus increases, the effective field decreases, leading to lower resonance frequencies. Since the resonance frequency is due to the chemical environment of the nuclear spin, the observed frequency is referred to as a
chemical shift. Due to differences in shielding, different spins will experience different local magnetic fields, giving rise to shifts in their frequencies.</p>

<p>For an isotropic electron distribution the shielding is given by the Lamb formula:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&sigma; = e<sup>2</sup>/3mc<sup>2</sup> ∫&rho;</i>(<i>r</i>)/<i>r</i> d<i>r</i></p>
</div>

<p>where σ represents the shielding of the nuclear spin. The local magnetic field strength at the nucleus is given by:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>B<sub>eff</sub> = (1 − σ) · B<sub>0</sub></i></p>
</div>

<p>In general, the electron distribution around a nucleus in a molecule is not spherically symmetric. Therefore, the size of electron current around the field, and hence the size of the shielding, will depend on the orientation of the molecule within the
applied field <i>B<sub>0</sub></i>. For anisotropic electron distributions the shielding is described by a tensor (the shielding of the nucleus is anisotropic: orientationally dependent). The tensor takes into account the fact that in general the induced field (<i>B<sub>ind</sub></i>) will not be parallel to the applied field (<i>B<sub>0</sub></i>) therefore it cannot be described by a single number, but must be described by a second-rank tensor:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&sigma;<sub>xx</sub> &emsp;&sigma;<sub>xy</sub> &emsp; &sigma;<sub>xz</sub></p>
<p>&sigma; = &emsp;&sigma;<sub>yx</sub> &emsp; &sigma;<sub>yy</sub> &emsp; &sigma;<sub>yz</sub></p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&sigma;<sub>zx</sub>&emsp; &sigma;<sub>zy</sub>  &emsp;&sigma;<sub>zz</sub></p>
</div>

<p>The chemical shielding hamiltonian acting on a spin is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>Ĥ<sub>cs</sub> = −&gamma; ℏ <b>Î</b> ⋅ <b>&sigma;</b> ⋅ <b>B<sub>0</sub></b></i></p>
</div>

<p>In the hypothesis of the external field <i>B<sub>0</sub></i> being along <i>z</i>, the local magnetic field <i>B<sub>loc</sub></i> at a nucleus is expressed as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>B<sub>loc</sub> = &sigma;</i> ⋅ (0 0 B<sub>0</sub>)<sup>T</sup></p>
</div>

<p>So, for instance, &sigma;<sub>xz</sub> ⋅ <i>B<sub>0</sub></i> is the local shielding field in the <i>x</i> direction, when <i>B<sub>0</sub></i> is applied along <i>z</i>.</p>

<p>If the applied field <i>B<sub>0</sub></i> is along <i>z</i>, then the shielding interaction hamiltonian in Equation becomes</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>Ĥ<sub>cs</sub> = −&gamma; ℏ <b>Î</b> ⋅ &sigma;</b><sub>zz</sub> ⋅ B<sub>0</sub></i></p>
</div>

<h2>Chemical Shift</h2>

<p>The dependence of the resonance frequency on the applied field, <i>B<sub>0</sub></i>, is removed by converting all frequencies to a dimensionless scale, known as the chemical shift scale. This scale is defined as:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&delta; = (ν − ν<sub>0</sub>)/&nu;<sub>0</sub> × 10<sup>6</sup></i></p>
</div>

<p>with units of ppm, or parts-per-million. The conversion from frequency to chemical shift makes the position of the spectral
line independent of the magnetic field strength (by dividing by <i>ν<sub>0</sub></i>). Thus, making it possible to directly compare the position of resonance lines in spectra that are obtained at different field strengths. For example, a resonance line at 2 ppm would be 600 Hz higher in frequency than the reference line on a 300 MHz (<i>ν<sub>H</sub></i>) magnet. On a 900 MHz magnet, the same line would have a resonance frequency that is 1800 Hz higher than the reference compound. The constant, <i>ν<sub>0</sub></i>, is a reference frequency, in units of Hertz (Hz). It is often the frequency of the line from a reference compound whose resonance is at one end of the spectrum. For example, tri-methyl silane is used to reference organic samples and its proton and carbon frequencies are set to zero ppm. In the case of protein solutions, the water line can be used as an approximate proton chemical shift reference point, with a chemical shift of about 4.70 ppm (see Section 3.7). Conversion of a chemical shift back to an absorption frequency requires knowledge of the magnetic field strength, or spectrometer frequency, from which the spectra was acquired. In addition, to determine the absolute frequency of the spectral line it is also necessary to know <i>ν<sub>0</sub></i> which can usually be approximated as the spectrometer frequency.</p>
