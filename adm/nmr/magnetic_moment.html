<h1>Magnetic Dipole</h1>

<p>The fundamental property that enables magnetic resonance spectroscopy is that <b>charged, spinning particels</b>, such as the proton, have a <a href="../../physics/magnetic_dipole_moment.html">magnetic dipole moment</a>. A macroscopic example of a magnetic dipole is a bar magnet, which has a north and south magnetic pole, hence the term "dipole". Another way you could make a macroscopic magnetic dipole would be to take a sphere, and place static electric charge on its surface, say, by rubbing it with cat fur. When the carged spehere is stationary, it can expercience electrical forces, but not magnetic forces. When you spin the sphere on you finger, it becomes a magnetic diple, like a bar magnet, with its magnetic north-south axis pointing along the axis about which the spehere is spinning.</p>

<p>When the sphere or the bar magnet are placed in an externally applied magnetic field, the spinning, charged sphere will experience a twisting force, or torque, that acts to align the axis of rotation so that it points along the direction of the magnetic field.</p>

<p>The nuclear magnetic dipole moment arises from the <i>spin angular momentum of the nucleus</i>.</p>

<p>Mass of the proton is nearly 1837 times heavies than the mass of electron and hence the electronic magnetic moment is greater that the nuclear magnetic moment by this ratio.</p>

<p>Based on classical physics, the neutron, being chargeless, should not have a magnetic dipole moment at all. Physisics were astonished when the measured magnetic dipole moment of the neutron was not zero, but was found to be nearly as large in magnitude as that of the proton, but opposite in sign: &mu;<sub>n</sub> = −1.91 &mu;<sub>N</sub> (&mu;<sub>N</sub> = one nuclear magneton). How could a chargeless particle have a magnetic dipole moment? If the neutron were a point-like, uncharged particle, it couldn't. The explanation for the neutro having a magnetic dipole moment is that, like the proton, the neutron is not a point-like particle. Although chargeless, the neutron is composed of three fractionally charged, spin-1/2 particles, called quarks. While quarks have never been found in free space, the anomalous magnetic dipole moments of both the proton and neutron, along  with their charges, masses and spins are explained by the quark model, in which the proton, neutron and all other strongly interacting particles, are composed of quarks.</p>

<h2>Nuclear Magnetic Moments</h2>

<p>The magnetic dipole moments of all nuclei are explained by the magnetic moments of the proton and neutron and by the number of protons and neutrons making up each nucleus. When proton occur in pairs or neutrons occur in pairs in a nucleus, they pair up like two bar magnets and cancel the effect of each other's magnetic dipole moments outside the nucleus. Thus, only nuclei with an unpaired proton, an unpaired neutron, ot both, have a net magneti dipole moment.</p>

<p>Hydrogen, the simplest nucleus has a single unpaired proton: its large magnetic moment along its relatevely small mass make it the strongest nuclear magnetic dipole moment. The second nucleus, that of helium, constists of two protons and two nuetrons. The two protons in the nucleus pair up exaclty to cancel their net magnetic effects; and the two neutrons, which have different magnetic moments than the proton, also pair up exactly to cancel their magnetic effects. Thus, the helium nucleus has no net magnetic dipole moment. Due to this pairing of proton and neutron, most atomic nuclei have no magnetic dipole moment and are, therefore, not suitable for NMR.</p>

<p>The most stable isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-14 has seven protons and seven neutrons in its nucleus. Six of the seven protons pair up and six of the seven nuetrons pair up, leaving on unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron. Because these two particels have different magnetic dipole moments, the unpaired proton and unpaired neutron do not cancel one another, so the nitrogen nucleus has a magnetic dipole moment that it less than the magnetic diple strenght of either the proton or neutron.</p>

<p>To sum up:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>All nuclei with an odd mass number (e.g. <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N) have spin angular momentum because they have an unpaired proton..</p></li>
	<li><p>All nuclei with an even mass number and an odd charge (e.g. <sup>2</sup>H, <sup>14</sup>N) also have spin angular momentum.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Spin angular momentum</h2>

<p>Magnetic nuclei poseess an intrinsic angular moementum known as <i>spin</i>, whose magnitude is quantized in units of ℏ</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>|<i><b>I</b></i>| = (<i>I</i>(<i>I</i>+1)<sup>1/2</sup> ℏ &emsp; (<b>1.3</b>)</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>spin quiantum number I</i>, of a nucleus may have one of the following values:</p>

<p><i>I</i> = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2,...</p>

<p>Spin angular momentum can be thought as a vector <b>I</b>, whose direction and magnitude are quantized. The lenght is given by (<b>1.3</b>). There are 2I+1 allowed projections onto an arbitrarly chosen axis, labelled <i>z</i>. That is, the projection of <b>I</b> onto the z-axis is quantized:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>I<sub>z</sub> = mℏ</i></p>
</div>

<p>where <i>m</i>, the magnetic quantum number has 2I+1 values between +I and -I:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>m</i> = I, I-1, I-1,...,-I</p>
</div>

<p>For example, the angular momentum of a spin-1/2 nucleus (e.g. <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C) has two permitted <i>z</i>-coomponents, I<sub>z</sub> = &pm; 1/2 ℏ, while a nucleus with I = 1 has three I<sub>z</sub> = 0, &pm; ℏ.</p>

<p>In the absense of a magnetic field, the axis of quantization is arbitrarly and all 2I+1 directions are equally likely and have the same energy.</p>

<p>The magnetic moment of a nucleus is intimately connected with its spin by the following relation</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i><b>&mu;</b> = &gamma; <b>I</b></i></p>
</div>

<p>where &gamma; is the magnetogyric ratios of the nucleus. Thus the magnetic moment of a nucleus is parallel to the spin angular momentum or sometimes, antiparallel for nuclei that have negative &gamma;.</p>
