<h1>Absorption of Radio Frequency Energy</h1>

<p>In order to measure the resonant frequency of each nucleus within a molecule, we need to have some way of getting the nuclei to absorb or emit RF energy. If we subject the sample to an oscillating magnetic field provided by a coil (the equivalent of a radio transmitter’s antenna), a spin in the lower energy state can be “bumped” into the higher energy state if the radio frequency is exactly equal to the Larmor frequency, <i>ν<sub>0</sub></i>. Formally, one spin jumps up to the higher energy level and one “photon” of electromagnetic radiation (energy <i>hν<sub>0</sub></i>) is absorbed. Unfortunately, there is another process that is equally likely, called “stimulated emission,” in which one photon (<i>hν<sub>0</sub></i>) is absorbed by a spin in the upper (β) energy state, kicking it down to the lower state with the emission of two photons. So as long as our RF energy is applied at the resonant frequency, spins are jumping up (absorption of one photon) and down (emission of one photon) constantly. The rate of these processes is proportional to the population of spins in each of the two states: absorption occurs at a rate proportional to the number of spins in the sample that are in the lower energy state, and emission occurs at a rate proportional to the number of spins in the upper energy state. In order to understand the net behavior of this system, we have to think about the populations (number of spins in the sample) in each of the two states. At thermal equilibrium, there will be a slight preference for the lower energy state according to the Boltzmann distribution. For now we will only think about this preference qualitatively; it turns out to be very small indeed at room temperature—a population difference of about 1 in 10<sup>6</sup> spins. But as long as there are more spins in the lower energy state, we will see a net absorption of RF energy when we turn on an RF energy source at the Larmor frequency. As there is a net migration of spins from the lower energy state to the upper energy state (absorption exceeds emission), we will quickly see the two populations become equal:</p>

<p>where <i>N</i> is the total number of identical spins in the sample and δ is a very small fraction of this number. With the equal populations, the rate of absorption equals the rate of emission and we no longer have any net absorption of RF energy. This condition is called <i>saturation</i>. If there were no other way for the spins to drop down to the lower energy state, this would
be the end of the NMR experiment: a quick burst of absorption and then nothing. But there is a pathway to reestablish the Boltzmann distribution: spins can drop down from the higher energy state to the lower energy state with the energy appearing as thermal energy
(molecular motion) instead of in the form of a photon. This process is called relaxation and is an extremely important phenomenon that will be discussed in detail. If our source of RF energy is weak enough, we can reach a steady state in which the absorption of RF energy is exactly equal to the rate of relaxation. The amount of energy absorbed is very small, and the heating of the sample resulting from relaxation is not even noticeable.</p>
