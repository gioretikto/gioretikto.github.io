<h1>BASH</h1>

<p><b>BASH</b> is an acronym for <b>B</b>ourne <b>A</b>gain <b>S</b>hell. It is based on the Bourne shell and is mostly compatible with its features.

<p>Shells are command interpreters. They are applications that provide users with the ability to give commands to their operating system interactively, or to execute batches of commands quickly. In no way are they required for the execution of programs; they are merely a layer between system function calls and the user.</p>

<p>Think of a shell as a way for you to speak to your system. Your system doesn't need it for most of its work, but it is an excellent interface between you and what your system can offer. It allows you to perform basic math, run basic tests and execute applications. More importantly, it allows you to combine these operations and connect applications to each other to perform complex and automated tasks.</p>

<p><b>BASH is not</b> your operating system. It is not your window manager. It is not your terminal (but it oftens runs inside your terminal). It does not control your mouse or keyboard. It does not configure your system, activate your screensaver, or open your files when you double-click them. It is generally not involved in launching applications from your window manager or desktop environment. <b>It's important to understand that BASH is only an interface for you to execute statements</b> (using BASH syntax), either at the interactive BASH prompt or via BASH scripts.</p>
