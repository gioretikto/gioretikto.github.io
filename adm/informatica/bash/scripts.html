<h1>Scripts</h1>

<p>When creating a shell script file, you must specify the shell you are using in the first line of the file. Here's the format for this:</p>

<pre>#!/bin/bash</pre>

<p>In a normal shell script line, the pound sign (#) is used as a comment line. A comment line in a shell script isnâ€™t processed by the shell. However, the first line of a shell script file is a special case, and the pound sign followed by the exclamation point tells the shell what shell to run the script under.</p>

<p>After indicating the shell, commands are entered onto each line of the file, followed by a carriage return. As mentioned, comments can be added by using the pound sign. An example looks like this:</p>

<pre>#!/bin/bash
# This script displays the date and who's logged on
date
who
</pre>

<p>The next step is to give the file owner permission to execute the file, using the chmod command:</p>

<pre>
$ chmod u+x test1
$ ./test1
</pre>

<h2>Subshell</h2>

<p>Running a shell script launches a new process, a <b>subshell</b>.

<div class="def">
Definition: A subshell is a child process launched by a shell (or shell script).
</div>

<p>A subshell is a separate instance of the command processor -- the shell that gives you the prompt at the console or in an xterm window. Just as your commands are interpreted at the command-line prompt, similarly does a script batch-process a list of commands. Each shell script running is, in effect, a subprocess (child process) of the parent shell.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Whenever you run a shell script, it creates a new process called subshell and your script will get executed using a subshell.</p></li>
	<li><p>A Subshell can be used to do parallel processing.</p></li>
	<li><p>If you start another shell on top of your current shell, it can be referred to as a subshell.</p></li>
</li>

<p>Type the following command to see subshell value:</p>

<pre>echo $BASH_SUBSHELL</pre>
