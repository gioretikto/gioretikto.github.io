<h1>info sulla motherboard</h1>

<p>There is a special console tool <b>dmidecode</b> which utilizes sysfs to provide information about your motherboard. Here is a brief description of the tool taken from its man page.</p>
 
<p><b>dmidecode</b> (where <i>dmi</i> stands for <i>Desktop Management interface</i>) is a tool that can access a table mantained by the System Management BIOS. SMBIOS and DMI are two standards tightly related and developed by the DMTF (Desktop Management Task Force).</p>

<p>The <b>System Management BIOS</b> (SMBIOS) specification defines data structures (and access methods) that can be used to read management information produced by the BIOS of a computer. This eliminates the need for the operating system to probe hardware directly to discover what devices are present in the computer. The SMBIOS specification is produced by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF), a non-profit standards development organization.</p>

<p>The Linux kernel contains an SMBIOS decoder, allowing systems administrators to inspect system hardware configuration and to enable or disable certain workarounds for problems with specific systems, based on the provided SMBIOS information.</p>

<p>The userspace command-line utility dmidecode inspects this data. Information provided by this utility typically includes the system manufacturer, model name, serial number, BIOS version and asset tag, as well other details of varying level of interest and reliability, depending on the system manufacturer. The information often includes usage status for the CPU sockets, expansion slots (including AGP, PCI and ISA) and memory module slots, and the list of I/O ports (including serial, parallel and USB).</p>

<p>As you run it, dmidecode will try to locate the DMI table. It will first try to read the DMI table from sysfs, and next try reading directly from memory if sysfs access failed. If dmidecode succeeds in locating a valid DMI table, it will then parse this table and display a list of records like this one:</p>
    
<pre>dmidecode -t 2</pre>

<p><i>-t</i> means type and type 2 is the motherboard.</p>
