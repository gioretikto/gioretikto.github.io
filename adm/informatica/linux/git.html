<h1>git</h1>

<h2>What is Git?</h2>

<p>Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</p>
 
<h2>How it works?</h2>

<p>Git deals&nbsp;with &nbsp;data more like a set of snapshots,&nbsp; a snapshots of a miniature filesystem. Every time you commit your file, or save the state of your project in the git project repository, it basically takes a snapshots. So, it stores a reference to that snapshot of what all of your files look like at that moment of commit. To be efficient, fast &amp; accurate if files have not changed, Git does not store that file again for further more changes with your commit. It just simply stored a link to the previous identical file it has already stored.</p>
 
<p>It is a great tool with great efficiency for handling&nbsp; large projects with hundred of thousand files with large project size.&nbsp;Git is primarily developed for Linux. Now a days, it also supports most major operating systems including BSD, Solaris, OS X, and even for Microsoft Windows.</p>

<h2>How I can use Git?</h2>

<p>There are a lot of different ways you can&nbsp;use Git. Most of the time we use command line tools and yes there are many graphical user interfaces (GUI) based software available as well.of varying capabilities. I&nbsp;will be using Git on the command line or terminal over here. Command line / terminal is the &nbsp;place where you can run all Git commands where as you can’t get all the features of Git&nbsp;on&nbsp;most of the GUIs based Git tools.</p>

<h2>Create your identity</h2>

<p>First, &nbsp;you need to &nbsp;set your user name and email address with git. This is very important as&nbsp;every Git commits you made uses this information.</p>
<pre> git config --global user.name "Mf Iftekher"</pre>
<pre> git config --global user.email xyz@xyz.com</pre>

<h2>Check your Git setting</h2>

<p>To check your git setting, issue the following command&nbsp;in your terminal.</p>

<pre>git config --list</pre>

<h2>Cloning a Git repository</h2>

<p>First, you must clone the git repository for your project to start with and only then you can commit your changes.</p>

<pre>git clone https://gitlab.com/xyz/abc.git</pre>

<p>The above command is showing how you can clone a git repository from a server. The server used in this example for git repository is gitlab and abc.git is the name. You can use the IP address of the git hosting server or the FQDN of that git sever.</p>

<h2>Initialize a new Git repository - Dopo aver creato il repository con l'interfaccia web</h2>

<p>If you want to start&nbsp;your own git repository sever for your codebase, issue the following command</p>

<pre>
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/gioretikto/spong.git
git push -u origin master
</pre>

<p>This will initiate a new git repository and the machine/host can be now used as a git repository server for that particular codebase. You can access the newly created repository by using the host’s IP or hostname.</p>

<h2>Checking Git status</h2>

<p>You can check the status of files in the index versus the working directory for your git repository by using the following command</p>

<pre>git status</pre>

<h2>Add a new file to Git repository</h2>

<p>Lets add a file to your newly created git repo. Goto your working folder for your source code.</p>

<p>Now create a demo file by issuing the following command</p>

<pre>vim demo.txt</pre>

<p>Add these following lines to the demo.txt file.</p>

<p>This is a demo file. This is second line of the file.</p>

<p>Our demo file has been created.&nbsp;Next, add this newly created file to the index of the git repo by issuing</p>
<pre> git add demo.txt</pre>
<p>Now, we need to commit this to your git repo by using</p>
<pre> git commit -m 'first commit'</pre>
<p>This will add the file “demo.txt” with it’s file content and with a comment “first commit” so that you can search it later.</p>
<p>Now, add a third line and commit it again.</p>

<pre>vim demo.txt</pre>

<p>Add these following content to the file.</p>
<p>This is a demo file. This is second line of the file. This is the third line.</p>
<pre>git commit -m 'second commit'</pre>

<p>This will update the file accordingly.</p>

<p>Now, push the changes to the repository.</p>
<pre> git push</pre>

<p>This will push the changes into the master branch.</p>

<h2>Caching your GitHub password in Git</h2>

<p>If you're cloning GitHub repositories using HTTPS, you can use a credential helper to tell Git to remember your GitHub
 username and password every time it talks to GitHub.</p>
 
<p>If you clone GitHub repositories using SSH, then you authenticate using SSH keys instead of a username and password.
 For help setting up an SSH connection, see Generating an SSH Key.</p>

<p>Turn on the credential helper so that Git will save your password in memory for some time. By default,
 Git will cache your password for 15 minutes. In Terminal, enter the following:</p>

</pre>
    $ git config --global credential.helper cache
    # Set git to use the credential memory cache
</pre>

<h2>Git ignore</h2>

<p>Per evitare che venga fatto l'upload di file oggetto</p>

<pre>git rm --cached '*.o'; echo '*.o' >> .gitignore; git add .gitignore; git commit -m "Ignore object files from now on"</pre>

<h2>Deleting a file from Git</h2>

<p>Say, you need to remove a file from your git. Just do the following one after another.</p>

<pre>git rm documentation.txt</pre>
<pre>git commit -m "documentation.txt &nbsp;file removed"</pre>
<pre>git push</pre>

<p>You are done removing&nbsp;documentation.txt from your git repository.</p>

<h2>Git Reset</h2>

<p>If you want to reset your index and working directory to the state of your last commit or to any commit then issue the following command in the terminal</p>

<pre>git reset --hard commit number/HEAD</pre>

<h2>Update all files</h2>

<p>Use the following script</p>

<pre>
git add .
git commit -m "update all"
git push
</pre>

<p>To authenticate automatically, run this command which will store the credentials:</p>

<pre>git config --global credential.helper store</pre>

<h2>Git Stash</h2>

<p>Say you made changes in one of your file but you don’t want to commit it to the repo then you can stash it and also you can push it later as well.</p>
<p>Simply type</p>
<pre>sudo git stash</pre>

<h2>Git Pull</h2>
<p>If you want to sync your local git codebase with the latest codebase of the git remote server repository, you need to use the following command. It will&nbsp;fetches files from the remote repository and merges it with your local one.</p>
<pre> git pull</pre>

<h2>Viewing log file</h2>

<p>If you want to see&nbsp;a listing of commits on a master branch including details&nbsp;with logs, type the following</p>

<pre> git log</pre>

<h2>Checking Git branch</h2>

<p>A Git repository can have multiple branch including master branch. To know your git branch, issue the following on your
 terminal</p>
 
<h2>Generate an SSH key</h2>

<p>Open terminal to create ssh keys:</p>

<pre>
cd ~                 #Your home directory
ssh-keygen -t rsa    #Press enter for all values
</pre>

<p>Here is a walkthrough on putty gen for the above steps</p>

<h3>Associate the SSH key with the remote repository</h3>

<p>This step varies, depending on how your remote is set up.</p>

<p>If it is a GitHub repository and you have administrative privileges, go to settings and click 'add SSH key'. Copy the contents of your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub into the field labeled 'Key'.</p>

<p>If your repository is administered by somebody else, give the administrator your id_rsa.pub.</p>

<p>If your remote repository is administered by your, you can use this command for example:</p>

<pre>
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub YOUR_USER@YOUR_IP:~/.ssh/authorized_keys/id_rsa.pub
</pre>

<p>Set your remote URL to a form that supports SSH 1</p>

<p>If you have done the steps above and are still getting the password prompt, make sure your repo URL is in the form</p>

<pre>
git+ssh://git@github.com/username/reponame.git
</pre>

<p>as opposed to</p>

<pre>https://github.com/username/reponame.git</pre>

<p>To see your repo URL, run:</p>

<pre>git remote show origin</pre>

<p>You can change the URL with:</p>

<pre>git remote set-url origin git+ssh://git@github.com/username/reponame.git</pre>
