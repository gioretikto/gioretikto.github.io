<h1>Data Packages</h1>

<p>Nello scendere dei dati giù lungo lo stack ciascun layer include informazioni rilevanti che vanno sotto il nome di <b>header</b> che si aggiungono ai dati ricevuti dal layer precedente. L'header e i dati vanno a formare il nuovo pacchetto dati fornito al livello successivo. Si ha il processo inverso quando i dati sono ricevuti dal computer destinatario. Al muoversi dei dati sù lungo lo stack ciascun layer spacchetta il corrispettivo header ed usa l'informazione.</p>

<p>As the data moves down through the stack, the effect is a little like the nested Russian wooden dolls you might have seen; the innermost doll is enclosed in another doll, which is then enclosed in another doll, and so on. At the receiving end, the data packages are unpacked, one by one, as the data climbs back up the protocol stack. </p>

<h3>Encapsulation</h3>

<p>The following steps take you through the flow of data through a network using the TCP/IP model protocol stack as reference:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Data flow within a TCP/IP network commences at the Application layer. For example, you use a network application such as a web browser to make a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request for a web page.</p></li>

	<li><p id="segment">At the Transport layer, data is provided to an applicable transport layer protocol − TCP or UDP. First, you convert the data into <b>segments</b> (TCP) or <b>datagrams</b> (if UDP). A data packet transported by TCP is called a segment and a data packet transported by UDP is called a datagram. At times, data is too large to be sent as one piece, e.g. a file transfer might require the file to be broken into several pieces and sent as such. A segment is given a <b>header</b> that identifies the sending application on one device (source) and the receiving application on its counterpart device (destination), usually identified using source and destination <b>port numbers</b>.</p></li>

	<li><p id="packet">At the Internet layer, an IP header, with a <b>source and destination IP address</b> is added to each TCP segment, encapsulating it into an Internel Protocol (IP) <b>packet</b>.</p></li>

	<li><p>The Network access layer uses the Ethernet protocol to encapsulate each packet into a <b>frame</b>. Each frame has a header including a source and destination MAC address, as well a cyclical redundancy check (CRC) field at the end of the frame to verify propert transmission. In this layer, the frames are also encoded into bits and are sent electronically over the medium by the network interface card (NIC)</p></li>

	<li><p>After the bits cross the physical medium and arrive at the destination, they are de-encapsulated up the protocol stack until data reaches the application. In this case, the HTTP request would reach the server application, and it would respond with web data and start the process again.</p></li>

</ol>

<h2 id="MTU">Fragmenting datagrams: IP fragmentation</h2>

<p>Each type of network has a <b>maximum transmission unit (MTU)</b>, which is the largest packet that it can transfer. If the datagram received from one network is longer than the other network’s MTU, the datagram must be divided into smaller fragments for transmission. This process is called fragmentation. Think of a train delivering a load of steel. Each railway car can carry more steel than the trucks that will take it along the highway, so each railway car’s load is unloaded onto many different trucks. We talk about datagram fragmentation as TCP normally implements Path MTU Discovery and can avoid IP fragmentation of TCP segments.</p>

<h3>Fragment ID</h3>

<p>A single large IP datagram is fragmented into several smaller IP datagramgs, each containing its own fragment ID. The receiving host then assembles all the fragments and uses the fragment ID fields to piece back together the fragments into the original IP datagram.</p>

<p>The fragmentation flags field indicated whether an IP datagram is a full datagram or just a frament of a larger one. The bit values for this field are as follows:</p>
