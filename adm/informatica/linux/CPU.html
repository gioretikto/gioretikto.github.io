<h1>CPU</h1>

<p>Before the rise of programmable computing systems, all computing machines were capable of only a small set of predetermined operations, e.g. the arithometer patented and manufactured in the 19th century by Thomas de Colmar was limited to only four operations, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division but it could not however be reprogrammed to process text input or to perform symbolic calculation. Von Neumann created a machine much easier to re-program. The two most commmon architectures of reprogrammable machines are the Von Neumann and the Harvard</p>

<p>The von Neumann architecture model proposed that not only should the data being processed be stored in memory, but that the instructions being used to process the data should also be stored in the same memory. Almost all modern computers are Neumann computers which are character</p>

<p>The CPU (central processing unit) − the centerpiece of the computer's architecture − is in charge of</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Fetching an instruction from memory.</p></li>
	<li><p>Decode the instrucion</p></li>
	<li><p>Execute the instruction</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When we want to execute a program, the first step is to 'fetch' it from memory. The next step <i>i.e.</i> decoding, involves the interpretation of the code as to what action is to be performed. After decodin, the action required is performed. This is termed 'instruction execution'. The sequence of these three actions is called the 'execution cycle'. The CPU executes these tasks using three main hardware elements:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>an <i>Arithmetic-Logic unit</i> (ALU);</p></li> 
	<li><p>The internal CPU memory consists of <i>registers</i>, and one or more <a href="CPU.html#cache">caches</a>; </p></li>
	<li><p>A <i>control unit</i>, CU.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>CPU instructions</h2>

<p>To tell the processor what to do, you have to give it instructions written in <i>machine language</i> − a language that the processor can understand. A machine code <i>instruction set</i> corresponds to the instructions it supports. You can think of a computer's instructions as set of switches; each switch is either ON (1) or OFF (0). A machine instruction can specify the type of operation to perform (addition, subtraction, etc), the register(s) or memory used, data, etc. A CPU is build to sequentially fetch instructions from memory and execute them, exactly as they are written.</p>

<p>Processing data and instructions are managed in a machine cyle. The <b>machine cycle</b> includes four steps tha a processor carries out for each instruction: fetch, decode, execute, and store. The control unit <i>fetches</i> data and instructions from the RAM. It transports the digital bits through an electronic bus, stores the instruction in registers, and <i>decodes</i> the instruction for the ALU. The ALU <i>executes</i> the instruction and returns the result to an accumulation register and storage register. WHen one machine-level instruction is completed, a second one is sent through the cycle. Eventually there is an instruction to <i>store</i> the results and the control unit moves data from its temporary storage register to a specific address in RAM. </p>

<p>All the activities of the processor and buses are syncronized by a <b>system clock</b>, a crystal oscillator circuit on a main board that times, or synchronizes, each step in the fetch-excute cycle. The reciprocal of the clock frequency is the cycle time <i>T</i>, also called the clock period. <i>T</i> = 1/<i>f</i> where <i>f</i> is the clock frequency. An execution cycle may require many clock periods. This depends on the architectural features of the processor, as well as the complexity of the instruction to be executed. </p>

<p>One important factor that contributes to CPU power is the amount of data or instructions that are moved through a processor in one machine cycle. <b>Word size</b> refers to the group of bits that a processor can manipulate as a unit in ome machine cycle. A 64-bit processor can manipulate 64 bits of data at one time, clearly an advantage over a 32-bit processor.</p>

<h2>ALU</h2>

<p>The <b>ALU</b> (Arithmetic Logic Unit) in the part of the microprocessor that performs arithmetic operations, such as addition and subtraction. It also performs logical operations, such as comparing two numbers to see if they are the same, and other logic operations such as AND, OR and NOT, setting bits, clearing bits. The ALU uses <b>registers</b> to hold data that is being processed.</p>

<p>Operations performed in the ALU oftern affect bits in the <b>status register</b> (bits are set to indicate actions such as whether an overflow has occure). <br> The ALU knows which operations to perform because it is controlled by signals from the <i>control unit</i>.</p>

<h2>Registers</h2>

<p>The CPU is designed to carry out simple calculations <i>quickly</i>. In order to boost performance, it is desirable to store the results of these calculations locally, rather that ship them in and out of memory. Thus, every CPU is equipped with a small set of high-speed <i>registers</i>, each capable of holding a single word.</p>

<p>Since programs contain instructions and data, the register section of the CPU contains four basic registers to hold instructions, operands, or any other that is required for execution. These registers are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Instruction Register (IR): After reading (fetching) an instruction from memory, the CPU stores it in the instruction register.</p></li>
	<li><p>Program Counter (PC), stores the memory address of the next instruction to be executed by the processor. It is also known as the instruction address register. PC tells the CPU where the next instruction to be executed is to be fetched from the main memory..</p></li>
	<li><p>Memory Address Register (MAR), used to hold the address of where the CPU wants to read or write data from or to the memory respectively. When a computer processor wants to read data from the main memory (RAM) address it will put that address on the MAR to be fetched;</p></li>
	<li><p>General Purpose Register (GPR), stores data addressed by MAR.</p></li>
	<li><p>Stack Pointer (SP): a special-purpose register that is used to keep track of the memory stack. SP stores the address and data of the stack that is currently on top. It uses a stack pointer to store or point to the address of the topmost stack. </p></li>
	<li><p>Flag Registers: A flag in computing is like an alarm or an alert that indicate if something has happened or not. Flag registers are used to control the flow of process execution by indicating the status of the operation.</p></li>
	<li><p>Segment Registers: These registers are used to manage memory segmentation and how they are accessed. A segment register is used to store the starting address of each memory segment. This helps the CPU determine where a specific segment start.</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Control Unit</h2>

<p>The <b>control unit</b> directs the flow of data and instructions within the processor and electronic memory. The main purpose of the CU is to translate or decode instructions and generate appropriate enable signals to accomplish the desired operation. A computer instruction is represented as a binary code, typically 16, 32, or 64 bits wide. Before such an instruction can be executed, it must be decoded, and the information embedded in it must be used to signal various hardware devices (ALU, registers, memory) how to execute the instruction. </p>

<p>The control unit performs two basic operations: instruction interpretation and instruction sequencing. In the interpretation phase, the control unit reads (fetches) an instruction from the memory addressed by the contents of the program counter into the instruction register. The control unit inputs the contents of the instruction register. It recognizes the instruction type, obtains the necessary operands, and routes them to the appropriate functional units of the execution unit (registers and ALU). The control unit then issues necessary signals to the execution unit to perform the desired operation and routes the results to the specified destination.</p>

<h2>The system bus</h2>

<p>A <b>bus</b> is an electronic path for the flow of data and instructions to and from the CPU to RAM. It is a parallel transmission component with each separate wire carrying a single bit. The <b>system bus</b> is an electronic pathway between the CPU, memory, and other system components. Each line in the bus allows transmittion of one bit of information. The capacity of the bus is defined in the number of lines in the bus. It is generally expressed as a 16-bit bus, 32 bit bus, or 64-bit bus, and so on. Now the capacity of a processor in the computer is expressed in terms of the size of the registers inside the CPU and the capacity of the bus. If the size of the register in the CPU is 32 bits and the size of the bus has 16 bits, the processor is referred to as 32/16 bits. Usually, the sizes of the registers and the bus are maintained at the same level, but difference in their sizes is also possible.</p>

<p>The processor has two bus connections to memory:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>The <b>data bus</b> is the set of pathways that carries the actual data between a particular memory location or I/O device and the CPU. A 64-bit data bus can move 8 bytes of data to the processor in the same machine cycle. The data bys width should be matched to the word size of the CPU for optimum performance. A <b>word</b> is a small number of bytes handled as a unit by the computer.</p></li>

	<li><p>WHich memory location or I/O device is where the address bus comes in. The system designed assigns each memory location and I/O device a unique memory address. When the software wants to access a particular memory location or I/O device, it places the corresponding address on the address bus. In modern systems, the samllest addressable unit of memory is one byte (8 bits), and thus each address corresponds to a unique memory locaton for one byte of storage. <br>  The <b>address bus</b> is the electronic pathway that carries information about the memory locations of data. The number of lines in the bus determines the number of memory locations that can be addressed by the CPU. Each line can be either in a state '0' or '1'. Thus a single line can address 2 diferent addressed (0 & 1). A 2-line bus will be able to access 2<sup>2</sup> = 4 memory locations (00, 01, 10, 11). Similary an 8-line bus can access 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 memory locations (from 00000000 to 11111111). 32-bit address bus can access 2<sup>32</sup> ≅ 4.2 GB of RAM. A 64-bit address range is truly infinite as fas as memory is concerned. No one will every put 2<sup>64</sup> addresses (bytes), of memory into a computer system and feel that they need more. </p></li>
	
	<li><p>The <b>control bus</b> is another bidirectional bus which trasmits a signal from the control unit to any other system component or trasmits a signal to the control unit. There is no need for extendend width so the control bus typically has just eight wires. A major use of the control bus is to carry timing signals. The system clock in the CU defines the clock cycle for the computer system. The control bus carries timing signals at time intervals dictated by the clock cycle. This ensures that the time that one component trasmits data is synchronised with the time that another component reads it.</p></li>

<h2 id="cache">Cache memory</h2>

<p>Cache is a small amount (normally less than 1MB) of high-speed memory residing on or close to the CPU. Cache memory supplies the processor with the most frequently requested data and instructions from the most frequently used RAM memory location. The CPU is designed such that it looks for data and instructions first in its cache(s) before searching RAM. <br> The cache memory lies in the path between the processor and the memory. The cache memory therefore, has lessr access time than memory and is faster than the main memory.</p>

<img src="img/cache.png" alt="cache"/>

<ul>
	<li><p>Level 1 cache (primary cache) is the cache closest to the processor (built into the processor core) It is relatively small (8KB-64KB). When the processor need to access memory it checks the contents of L1 chache first.</p></li>

	<li><p>Level 2 cache (secondary cache; SRAM) is the cache second closest to the processor and is usually on the motherboard. The advantages are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Cache memory is faster than main memory;</p></li>
	<li><p>It consumes less access time as compared to main memory.</p></li>
	<li><p>It stores the program that can be executed within a short period of time;</p></li>
	<li><p>It stores data for temporary use.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The disadvantage are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>It has limited capacity;</p></li>
	<li><p>It is very expensive.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>RISC and CISC</h2>

<p>Early microprocessor (including 80x86 and its predecessors) are examples of Complex instruction set computers (CISCs). At the time thse CPUs were created, the thinking was that having each instruction do more work made program run faster because they executed fewer instructions (as CPUs with less complex instruction had to execute more instruction to do the same amount of work). <br> In the early 1980s, computer architecture researches discovered that this complexity came at a huge cost. All the hardware necessary to support these complex instruction wound up constratining the overall clock speed of the CPU. Experiments with teh VAX 11-780 microcomputer demonstrated that programs executing multiple, simple, instruction were faster than those executing fewer, more complex, instructions. <br>If we can reduce the amount of time it takes for CPU to execute the individual instructions in its instruction set, an application containing a sequence of those insturction will also run faster that it otherwise would. They called this new architecture <i>Reduced Instruction Set Computer</i> (RISC), RISC processors have fast instruction execution, and this also reduces the size and power consumption of the processing unit. While a RISC CPU may exercute instructions faster and cost less than a CISC, its individual instructions are much simple, so that it would have to execute several instruction in oder to perform the equivalent function of a single CISC instruction. In addtion, the RISC will require more memory to store the extra instructions, so that at the end of the day there may be little to choose between a RICS and a CISC CPU. </p>
