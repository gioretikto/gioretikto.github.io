<h1>sed command</h1>

<p><b>sed</b> (stream editor) is a Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact programming language. sed was developed from 1973 to 1974 by Lee E. McMahon of Bell Labs,[1] and is available today for most operating systems. sed was based on the scripting features of the interactive editor ed ("editor", 1971) and the earlier qed ("quick editor", 1965â€“66). sed was one of the earliest tools to support regular expressions, and remains in use for text processing, most notably with the substitution command. Popular alternative tools for plaintext string manipulation and "stream editing" include AWK and Perl. </p>

<p>The sed script can either be specified on the command line (-e option) or read from a separate file (-f option). Commands in the sed script may take an optional address, in terms of line numbers or regular expressions. The address determines when the command is run. For example, 2d would only run the d (delete) command on the second input line (printing all lines but the second), while /^ /d would delete all lines beginning with a space.</p>

<p>Per eliminare tutte le righe che iniziano per "S" e per "e":</p>

<pre>sed -e '/^[Se]/d' myspace > space</pre>

<p>So to delete all empty lines from a file called /tmp/data.txt, enter:</p>

<pre>sed '/^$/d' /tmp/data.txt > /tmp/output.txt</pre>

<h2>Remove line numbers from a code block</h2>

<pre>sed 's/ *[0-9]*.//' app_open_files.c > app_open_filesmo-line-numbers.c</p>
