<h1>Parallel Computing</h1>

<p>Due to the physical limitations of the technology, keeping up with Moore's Law by increasing the number of transistors on the limited chip area has been becoming a more difficult challenge for the CPU industry. In the past decade, we witnessed an increasing number of hardware architectures that shift towards parallelism instead of clock speed. The industry has gradually turned to parallelism in computational architectures with the hope of living up to Moore’s law in terms of GFLOPS (1 GFLOPS = 109 floating-point-operations per second) performance growth per chip area instead of transistors growth per chip area. The prominent CPU vendors (namely, Intel and AMD) are packing two or more cores into each processor unit while the clock speed no longer grows at the rate of as Moore law dictates
the transistor density growth. <br> A <b>core</b> is essentially a mini-CPU with its own control unit, arithmetic-logic unit(s), registers and cache, However, multiple cores share the same "chip" as well as higher level cache, connections to main memory, and to the outside world. Multiple cores on a single CPU often have separate level-1 caches while sharing common level-2 and hiher level caches. <br>The multi-core processor architecture has become an industrial standard and is gradually changing the way people write programs.</p>

<p>In essence, a multi-core processor is a single chip containing more than one microprocessor core, which multiplies the potential performance with the number of cores. Some components, such as the bus interface and second level cache, are shared between cores. Because the cores are physically very close, they communicate at much higher bandwidth and speed compared to conventional discrete multiprocessor systems, which significantly reduces the communication overhead and improves overall system performance.</p>

<p>In order to fully utilize the multi-core capability, the programmers need to explicitly migrate their sequential code into parallel version. This opens the door to introduce many subtle concurrent
programming errors that could be very difficult to detect and uncover. </p>
