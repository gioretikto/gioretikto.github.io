<h1>Shell, Terminal and console</h1>

<p>A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts. Some examples of Shells are: Bourne shell, C shell, Bourne - Again shell, the korn shel, etc.The Bash shell is usually the default command-line interpreter on Linux systems.</p>

<p>The <b>window</b> of the command interpreter (in which the Bash inbterpreter runs and a command line prompt is provided for the user) is called the <b>terminal window</b>, or <b>console</b>. Examples of terminals are <i>Xterm, xfce4-terminal</i>.</p>

<p><b>Terminals</b> are devices with which users can interact with a computer. Using a terminal, a user can get command-line access to interact with the computer's operating system. A <b>shell</b> is the program that the terminal sends user input to. The shell generates output and passes it back to the terminal for display.  The shell has a terminal as standard input and standard output.</p>

<p>Here's an important point that should make more sense now that you have these terminals - Your choice of shell doesn't and shouldn't dictate your choice of terminal application.</p>

<p>There are two modes in which terminals can operate:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><b>Canonical mode</b> (<b>Line mode</b>): In canonical mode, the inputs from the user are processed line by line, and the user has to press the Enter key for the characters to be sent to the program for processing.</p>
	
	<li><p><b>Noncanonical</b> or <b>raw mode</b>: In raw mode, terminal input is not collected into lines, but the program can read each character as it is typed by the user.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Terminals can be either physical devices or virtual devices. Most terminals today are <b>pseudo-terminals</b>, which are virtual devices that are connected to a terminal device on one side, and to a program that drives the terminal device on the other end. Pseudo-terminals help us write programs where a user on one host machine can execute a terminal-oriented program on another host machine using network communications. An example of a pseudo-terminal application is <b>SSH</b>, which allows a user to log in to a remote host over a network.</p>

<h2>Double quotes and single quotes</h2>

<p>Enclosing characters in <b>single quotes</b> (') preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes. A single quote may not occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash. </p>

<p>Enclosing characters in <b>double quotes</b> (") preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of $, `, \, and, when history expansion is enabled, !. The characters $ and ` retain their special meaning within double quotes (see Shell Expansions). The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following characters: $, `, ", \, or newline. Within double quotes, backslashes that are followed by one of these characters are removed. Backslashes preceding characters without a special meaning are left unmodified. A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a backslash. If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless an ! appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash. The backslash preceding the ! is not removed.</p>

<p>Therefore we need the following</p>

<pre>./jac '5!+1'</pre>

<p>otherwise we would get: bash: !+1: event not found</p>
