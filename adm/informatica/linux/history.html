<h1>Shell history</h1>

<p>The bash shell saves commands entered from terminal to a history file. You can recall the list of commands previously typed. The history command displays bash commands that you executed prior. These commands make up your command history. By default, history shows a numbered list of the 500 most recent commands, from earliest to most recent. The value of the HISTSIZE variable is used as the number of commands to save in a history list.</p>

<p>Use echo command or printf command:</p>

<pre>echo "$HISTSIZE"</pre>

<p>OR</p>

<pre>printf "%d\n" $HISTSIZE</pre>

<p>Sample outputs:</p>

<pre>1000</pre>

<p>The value of the HISTSIZE variable indicates that the 1000 number of commands saved in a history list.</p>

<h2>Where are my bash history commands stored</h2>

<p>The history is initialized from the file named by the variable HISTFILE. The default is ~/.bash_history file. To view current settings run:</p>

<pre>echo "$HISTFILE"</pre>

<p>OR</p>

<pre>printf "%s\n" "$HISTFILE"</pre>

<p>Sample outputs:</p>

<pre>/root/.bash_history</pre>

<p>You can use a <i>cat</i> or <i>history</i> command to read all history commands you have entered previously:</p>
<pre>
$ cat ~/.bash_history
</pre>

<p>OR</p>

<pre>$ history</pre>

<h2>Clean command history</h2>

<p>Run the following linux command to clean both history file and all currently history file unsaved commands:</po>

<pre>$ history -c</pre>

<p>After you execute the above command you will no longer be able to access history for both saved and unsaved history commands. </p>

<h2>Disable history for a current shell</h2>

<p>When you login to your Linux box you can disable a all command to be stored into a history file.bash_history by running a following command:</p>

<pre>$ set +o history</pre>

<p>What the above command will do is that it will prevent your shell from storing all commands entered during your current shell session into the .bash_history file. You will also not be able to revoke any of your previously entered commands.</p>

<h2>Permanently disable bash history</h2>

<p>All the above commands will disable your command history for a current shell only. To permanently disable shell command history run the following linux command:</p>

<pre>echo 'set +o history' >> ~/.bashrc</pre>

<p>Next time you login your shell will not store any commands to a history file .bash_history. To apply this settings immediately for your current shell session source your .bashrc file:</p>

<pre>$ . ~/.bashrc</pre>

<p>Run the bellow command if you need to disable a command history system wide:</p>

<pre># echo 'set +o history' >> /etc/profile</pre>
