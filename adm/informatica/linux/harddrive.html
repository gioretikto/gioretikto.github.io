<h1>Hard Drives</h1>

<p>Hard drives usually consist of several disks on a single spindle. Each disk surface is able to store data and this ha the advantage that each surface can have its own read/write heads. This enables the read/write heads to operate simultaneously, which mean that the data can be trasferred more quickly than by using a single large disk.</p>
