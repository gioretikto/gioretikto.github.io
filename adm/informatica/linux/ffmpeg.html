<h1>ffmepg</h1>

<p>FFmpeg is a free and open-source project consisting of a vast software suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams. At its core is the FFmpeg program itself, designed for command-line-based processing of video and audio files, and widely used for format transcoding, basic editing (trimming and concatenation), video scaling, video post-production effects, and standards compliance (SMPTE, ITU). FFmpeg includes libavcodec, an audio/video codec library used by many commercial and free software products, libavformat (Lavf),[6] an audio/video container mux and demux library, and the core ffmpeg command line program for transcoding multimedia files. FFmpeg is published under the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1+ or GNU General Public License 2+ (depending on which options are enabled).</p>

<p>The name of the project is inspired by the MPEG video standards group, together with "FF" for "fast forward".[8] The logo uses a zigzag pattern that shows how MPEG video codecs handle entropy encoding.</p>

<p>FFmpeg is part of the workflow of hundreds of other software projects, and its libraries are a core part of software media players such as VLC, and has been included in core processing for YouTube and the iTunes inventory of files. Codecs for the encoding and/or decoding of most of all known audio and video file formats is included, making it highly useful for the transcoding of common and uncommon media files into a single common format. </p>

<h2>Installlation fedora</h2>

<p>RPM Fusion provides software that the Fedora Project or Red Hat doesn't want to ship. That software is provided as precompiled RPMs for all current Fedora versions and current Red Hat Enterprise Linux or clones versions; you can use the RPM Fusion repositories with tools like yum and PackageKit. </p>

<p>You can install VLC from the RPMFusion repo (see https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration) if you want to play mp4 files (install ffmpeg-libs from the same repo to be able to play more video formats inside Firefox)</p>

<p>This command will add the rpmfusion to the repositories.</p>

<pre>sudo rpm -Uvh https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-30.noarch.rpm</pre>

<p>As for the switches: -U = update the package if it already exists, install it otherwise (in this case, -i = install would work too, but if you already have a version of the package installed, it will try to install both in parallel, which usually doesn't work, so I recommend always using -U), -v = verbose, -h = "hashes" = show progress bars using '#' ("hash") characters.</p>
