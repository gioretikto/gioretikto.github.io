<h1>Copying files</h1>

<p>Copying files and directories from one location in the filesystem to another is a common practice for system administrators. The <i>cp</i> command provides this feature. <br> In its most basic form, the <i>cp</i> command uses two parameters − the source object and the destination object:</p>

<pre>cp source destination</pre>

<p>When both the source and destination parameters are filenames, the <i>cp</i> command copies the source file to a new destination file. The new file acts like a brand-new file, with an updated modification time:</p>

<pre>$cp test_one test_two
$ ls -l test_one test_two
-rw-rw-r--. 1 cadmio camdio 0 Jul 13 14:23 test_one
-rw-rw-r--. 1 cadmio camdio 0 Jul 13 14:46 test_two
</pre>

<p>If the destination file already exists, the <i>cp</i> command may not prompt you to this fact. It is best to add the <i>-i</i> option to force the shell to ask whether you want to overwrite a file:</p>

<pre>$cp test_one test_two
cp: overwrite "test_two"? n
</pre>

<p>If you don't answer 'y', the file copy does not proceed. You can also copy a file intoa preexisting directory:</p>

<pre>$cp -i test_one /home/cadmio/Documents/</pre>

<p>Earlier, you read about the special symbols that can be used in relative directory references. One of them, the single dot (.), is great to use with the <i>cp</i> command. Remember that the single dot represents your current directory. If you need to copy a file with a long source object name to your current working directory, the single dot can simplify the task: </p>

<pre>cp /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf .</pre>

<p>The <i>-R</i> parameter is a powerful <i>cp</i> command option. It allows you to recursively copy the contents of an entire directory in one command:</p>

<pre>$cp -R Documents/ NewDocuments/</pre>

<p>The direcory <i>NewDocuments</i> did not exist prior to the <I>cp -R</i> command, It was created with the cp -R command, and the entire Documents directory's contentes were copies into it. All files in the new <i>NewDocuments</i> directory have new dates associated with them. Now <i>NewDocuments</i> is a complete copy of the <i>Documents</i> directory.</p>

<p>You can also use wildcard metacharacter in your <i>cp</i> command:</p>

<pre>$ cp my NewDocuments/</pre>

<p>This command copied any files that started with <i>my</i> to <i>NewDocuments</i>.</p>

<h2>Copying a file only when it is newer than the destination</h2>

<pre>cp -auTv source/ dest/ </pre>

<p>you could also use</p>

<pre>rsync -auvi --dry-run source/ dest/</pre>

<p> for a preview what would happen and then remove <code>--dry-run</code> to actually copy the files/dirs. <code>rsync</code> is much slower than cp though.</p>
