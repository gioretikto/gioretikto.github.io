<h1>alsamixer</h1>

<p>The alsamixer utility is an ncurses application, which means that it is viewed graphically from a shell. It can be used to manage sound levels for more than one sound card on a computer, each with multiple devices representing it. Type <code>alsamixer</code> from a Terminal window to start it in playback mode (to adjust audio output) or <code>alsamixer -V capture</code> (to select an audio capture device and adjust audio capture level).</p>

<p>Tracks that are muted appear with an <b>MM</b> at the bottom of the slider. When unmuted, <b>00</b> appears instead. Press <b>m</b> to unmute. If more tracks are available than can appear on the screen, the nght arrow key enables you to scroll to the right to display additional track bars.</p>

<p><b>TIP</b>: If you have more than one sound card, each sound card is identified by a number, with zero, identifying the first sound card. For example, to start alsamixer for your second sound card, type <code>$ alsamixer -c 1.</code> Here are some ways to adjust your audio tracks with alsamixer:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Use the nght and left arrow keys to move among the different sound tracks.</p></li>

	<li><p>Use the up and down arrow keys to adjust the levels of the current tracks.</p></li>

	<li><p>Press m to mute or unmute the current track (playback mode only).</p></li>

	<li><p>Press the spacebar to make the current track the capture device, for devices such as microphone or line-in that are appropriate for capturing audio. Then adjust the Capture bar to set the level at which audio is captured. (Note that this feature works in capture mode only: <code>alsamixer -v capture</code>.)</p></li>
