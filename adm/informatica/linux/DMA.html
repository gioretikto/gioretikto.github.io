<h1>Direct Memory Access (DMA) module</h1>

<p>In order to boost system performance and save the precious CPU cycles, DMA <b>(Direct Memory Access)</b> is introduced. An extra piece of hardware called DMA controller is placed onto the memory bus to off-load the CPU core from the job of large data transfering. The CPU core has to configure the DMA controller and kick off the data transferring. When the job is done, the DMA controller will notify the CPUT core through interrupt. And CPU core gets to execute more important jobs in between.</p>

<p><a href="interrupt.html">Interrupt-driven I/O</a>, though more efficient than simple programmed I/O, still requires active intervention of the CPU to transfer data between memory and an VO module, and any data transfer must traverse a path through the CPU. Thus, both these forms of I/O suffer from two inherent drawbacks. <br> The I/O transfer rate is limited by the speed with which the CPU can test and service the interrupt from a device. The CPU is tied up in managing an I/O transfer. <br> The designers have thought of placing an additional module on the system bus. This module releases the CPU during data transfer involving a device. This module is named <b>Direct Memory Access (DMA) module</b>. The technique works as follows. When the CPU wishes to read or write a block of data, it issues a command to the DMA module by sending the following information to it:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>The address of the I/O device</p></li>
	<li><p>The I/O command</p></li>
	<li><p>The starting location in memory to read from or write to</p></li>
	<li><p>The number of bytes to be read or written</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The CPU then continues with other work. The complete I/O operations is delegated to the DMA module. The DMA module transfers the entire block of data, directly to or from memory, without going through the CPU. When the transfer is comple, the DMA module sends and interrupt to the CPU. Thus, the CPU is involved only at the beginning and at the end of the transfer.<br> DMA is supposed to be far more efficient than interrupt-drive or programmed I/O.</p>

<h2>DMA Controller</h2>

<p>In DMA, the DMA controller takes care of data transfer from device to memory (for reading from device) and from memory to device (for writing into the device). The controller needs to be provided by the CPU with device address, address of the memory location where the data belongs to and the number of bytes that need to be transferred, before it can start action. During data transfer, the memory bus needs to be released by the CPU and DMA should be allowed to control the bus. So, as far as the memory bus is cocerned, the CPU goes in an idle state.</p>

<p>The interal logic of a DMA device is shown inf Fig. 1. It can be seen that the device uses a number of registers to store the information required to perform the DMA transfer.</p>

<p>The DMA controller is initiated by a data request from the microprocessor, adter which the DAM device takes control of the system bus to perform the data move. Several DMA transfer methods and bus access techiniques exist, the two most often used being: the halt, also called the suspend or idle method and the cycle-stealing method.</p>
