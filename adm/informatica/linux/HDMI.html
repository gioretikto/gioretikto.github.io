<h1>HighDefinition Multimedia Interface (HDMI)</h1>

<p>HighDefinition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is an established standard that is capable of the highest-quality audio, video resolution, and video refresh rates offered by consumer electronics. Digital HDMI audio/video connections are used for both audio and video — all over a single cable. <br> HDMI uses the same video signaling as DVI, which makes it very compatible with computer displays, while providing superior performance characteristics when compared to VGA. Also, remember that VGA is analog, while HDMI is digital.</p>

<h2>VGA</h2>

<p>The <b>Video Graphics Array (VGA)</b> video standard for personal computers was introduced by IBM in 1987. VGA is an analog interface that remains in widespread use today, though most modern computers do not provide a VGA connector. It is not uncommon to find older computers with VGA outputs using a converter cable to present a display on a monitor supporting DVI or HDMI video input. Modern versions of the VGA standard support display resolutions up to 1,920 pixels wide by 1,200 pixels high, refreshed at 60 Hz. Because the VGA video signal is analog, some loss of signal quality occurs during transmission to the display. This effect is most noticeable at high screen resolutions.</p>

<h2>DVI</h2>

<p>The <b>Digital Visual Interface (DVI)</b> video standard was developed to improve the visual quality of computer displays by transferring the video signal digitally from the computer to the monitor. To maintain backward compatibility with older computers and monitors, DVI cables are capable of carrying VGA analog signals as well. Similar to the high-speed serial interfaces discussed earlier in this chapter, DVI uses
differential serial signaling to transfer video data. A DVI connector contains four serial lanes: individual lanes carry red, green, and blue color information, and the fourth lane carries the common clock signal. Three DVI variants are defined, depending on the combination of digital and analog video options supported:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><b>DVI-A</b> supports only the analog video signal. This option is intended to provide backward compatibility with VGA computers and monitors. The DVI-A connector has a different pin layout than traditional VGA connectors, so an adapter cable is required to connect to legacy VGA devices.</p></li>

	<li><p><b>DVI-D</b> isa digital-only interface supporting single-link and dual-link options. The dual-link option provides additional serial data lanes to increase the video bandwidth for higher-resolution displays. Dual-link does not mean the cable supports dual monitors.</p></li>

	<li><p><b>DVI-I</b> is an integrated interface supporting both the analog interface of DVI-A and the digital modes of DVI-D. A DVI-I digital interface may be single- or dual-link. DVI interfaces are used primarily in computer display applications. The effective data rate of a single-link DVI-D connection is 3.96 gigabits per second (Gbit/s). Dual-link DVI-D transfers video data at twice the single-link rate, 7.92 Gbit/s.</p></li>
