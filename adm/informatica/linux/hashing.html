<h1>Hashing</h1>

<p><i>Hashing</i> is a method used to verify data integrity. Hashing refers to the process of generating unique output based on an input, often called a message authentication code (MAC). This output of a hashing operation will always be the same, based on the input, and so changing the input results in a different output. A cryptographic has function is a process that takes a block of data and creates a small fixed-sized value. Hashing also operates on the principle of <i>collision avoidance</i>. This means that for every unique input, there is an equally unique output, and two unique inputs should never return the same hash value. This can be useful for cryptographic integrity checks, as discussed shortly.</p>

<p>Common hashing protocols are Message Digest 5 (MD5) and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA). Many others exist, but in this section, we focus on SHA-256. The process of creating a hash is useful for signing data, providing integrity checks, and outputting data at a consistent length. For example, SHA-256 takes any input and always outputs a 32-byte hash. This hash is in hex, and each hex value actually represents 8 bits in the hash (32 x 8 = 256), which is how we derive the 256 bits in SHA-256. Next example shows a hash being generated on a few different inputs. The first is the test input <i>abc</i>, which is used to confirm that the hashing program is actually returning proper outputs. Remember that two different devices performing a hash on the same input will always return the same output.</p>

<pre>echo -n abc | sha256sum
ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad
echo -n A short sentence | sha256sum</pre>

<p>You can run a hash on a text file, create with the contents "abc". Say that you want to copy this file to another device. To confirm that nothing has beed inadvertenly changed, you can compute the hash again.</p>

<pre>sha256sum file.txt 
ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad  file.txt</pre>

<p>In this case, it matches, thus confirming that the hashing program is functioning correctly. The next example shows the input "A short sentence", which outputs a 32-byte hash. The final input is much longer and also outputs a 32-byte hash.</p>

<h2>Check ISO-integrity</h2>

<p>Use a SHA256 checksum program to verify that the ISO image that you copied is intact. Compare this hash to the hash displayed for this particular image on the Download Software page.</p>

<pre>sha256sum openSUSE-Leap-42.2-NET-x86_64.iso</pre>

<p>sha256sum should then print out a single line after calculating the hash:</p>
