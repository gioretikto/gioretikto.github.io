<h1>8085</h1>

<p>Even though it is not a member of the x86 family and was never used in PCs, the 8085 microprocessero has in imortant place in history. The 8085 was released by Intel in 1976. It is a 40-pint DIP (dual in line package, in which the pins are mounted as two parallel rows of a rectangular housing). This chip has eight data pins and 16 address pins. Thus data can be read in and out from the chip as eight bits at a time. The fact that it has 16 address lines imply that the amount of memory it can access is 2<sup>16</sup> bytes − <i>i.e.</i>, it can have access to memory of 64 KB at the maximum. Besides the data and address pins, it has a number of control pins as well.</p>

<p>Each instruction performs an operation on the specified data called <b>operand</b>. An operand must be specified for an instruction to be executed. The operand may be in the general purpose register, accumulator or in a memory location.</p>

<p><b>Accumulator</b>: It is an 8-bit register connected to ALU via 8-bit internal data bus. One of the operands is always stored in the accumulator. After performing the operation, ALU places its contents/results in the accumulator. For example, if the operation is 30 + 15, either 15 or 30 is already in the accumulator. After addition, the result is also stored in the accumulator. Remember the numbers 15 and 30 are called <i>operands</i>.</p>

<p><b>Temporary register</b>: Out of the two inputs to the ALU, one is from the accumulator and the other is from the temporary register. For example, ADD B means to add the contents of the B register to the contents in the accumulator. In fact, when this command is executed, the contents of B register are brought to the temporary register and the addition is performed.</p>

<p><b>Program counter</b>: This is a 16-bit register always pointing to the address of memory from where the next instruction is to be fetched and executed. While the microprocessor is executing the instruction, the program counter is automatically incremented to fetch the next instruction for execution. Upon reset, the program contents are set to 0000.</p>

<p><b>Stack pointer</b>: It is a 16.bit register used to store the address of the stack. The stack is a portion (any) of the memory.</p>

<h2>Register Section</h2>

<p><b>General Purpose Registers</b>: The 8085 microprocessor consists of six 8-bit (each) general purpose registers named as B, C, D, E, H and L. These registers individually can be used to store 8-bit data and 16-bit data can be stored with register-s pair. The valid register pairs available in the 8085 microprocessor are BC, DE, and HL. These registers are available to the user and can also be programmed by the user. The programmer can use these registers to hold data, result of arithmetic and logical operations and address of data memory. The HL register pair can be used as data pointer and memory pointer. It holds the address of a 16-bit address of memory location when used as memory pointer.</p>

<h2>Special Purpose Registers: The special purpose registers are used for special use.</h2>

<h2>These are instruction register, program counter, and stack counter.</p>

<p><b>Instruction Register</b>: The register that holds the opcode of instruction from memory which has to be decoded and executed is called instruction register. It is not accessible to the user. The CPU stores the opcode in instruction register and further sent to the
instruction decoder-to select one of the 256 alternatives.</p>

<p><b>Program Counter (PC)</b>: Program counter is a 16-bit register, at a given time it stores the address ofthe next instruction to be fetch i.e., it holds the memory address of the next instruction to be executed. During instruction fetch operation, the processor places contents of program counter on the address bus and fetch first byte of the instruction from that memory location. Then the processor increments program counter to point the next byte of the instruction. The program counter is set to the address of the first ‘instruction to be fetch and executed when reset is activated. The reset address of the 8085 microprocessor is OOOOH. In case of jump and call instructions, the address followed by the jump and call instructions is placed in the program counter. If the condition is fulfilling then the processor fetch the next instruction from the new address specified by JUMP or CALL instruction otherwise processor continues with the next instruction after JUMP or CALL instruction.</p>

<p><b>Stack Pointer (SP)</b>: The stack pointer is a 16-bit register to define the stack starting address and usually it points at top of the stack. Thus it is used to keep track of data stored on stack and the stack is a reserved area of the memory where register pair
information can be stored or taken back under software control. The stack point is decremented after each stack write operation and incremented after each stack read operation. A transfer type instruction can load the stack pointer with initial value that is highest address of an assigned stack in memory. Thus stack should be always initialized in data memory.</p>

<p><b>Increment/decrement register</b>: Program counter and Stack pointer registers may be incremented/decrementd using this register. 

<h2>Address Buffer</h2>

<p>This is an 8-bit unidirectional buffer and used to derive the higher order address bus (A, — A,,). It is used to tri-state the higher order address buses under certain conditions such as reset, hold, halt and when address lines are not in use.</p>

<h2>Instruction Decoder and Machine Cycle Encoder</h2>

This section is used to accept opcode from instruction register, decode it and provide the decoded
information to control logic. The instructions are recognized in this block means what operation
has to perform, who is going to perform it, how many operand byte are in instruction, etc. The
status of machine cycle is resolute by machine cycle encoder means it gives the information
about which machine cycle is currently being executed.
