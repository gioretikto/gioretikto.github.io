<h1>Memory Usage</h1>

<p>On linux, there are commands for almost everything, because the gui might not be always available. When working on servers only shell access is available and everything has to be done from these commands. So today we shall be checking the commands that can be used to check memory usage on a linux system. Memory include RAM and swap.</p>

<p>It is often important to check memory usage and memory used per process on servers so that resources do not fall short and users are able to access the server. For example a website. If you are running a webserver, then the server must have enough memory to serve the visitors to the site. If not, the site would become very slow or even go down when there is a traffic spike, simply because memory would fall short. Its just like what happens on your desktop PC.</p>

<h3>free command</h3>

<p>The free command is the most simple and easy to use command to check memory usage on linux. Here is a quick example</p>

<pre>
free -h
               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           3.7Gi       736Mi       2.4Gi        55Mi       577Mi       2.7Gi
Swap:          974Mi          0B       974Mi
</pre>

<p>The <i>m</i> option displays all data in MBs.</p>

<pre>$ free -m
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          7976       6459       1517          0        865       2248
-/+ buffers/cache:       3344       4631
Swap:         1951          0       1951</pre>

<p>The total os 7976 MB is the total amount of RAM installed on the system, that is 8GB. The used column shows the amount of RAM that has been used by linux, in this case around 6.4 GB. The output is pretty self explanatory. The catch over here is the cached and buffers column. The second line tells that 4.6 GB is free. This is the free memory in first line added with the buffers and cached amount of memory.</p>

<p>Linux has the habit of caching lots of things for faster performance, so that memory can be freed and used if needed.
The last line is the swap memory, which in this case is lying entirely free.</p>

<h3>2. /proc/meminfo</h3>

<p>The next way to check memory usage is to read the <i>/proc/meminfo</i> file. Know that the <i>/proc</i> file system does not contain real files. They are rather virtual files that contain dynamic information about the kernel and the system.</p>

<pre>$ cat /proc/meminfo

<p>Check the values of MemTotal, MemFree, Buffers, Cached, SwapTotal, SwapFree. They indicate same values of memory usage as the free command.</p>

<h3>3. vmstat</h3>

<p>The vmstat command with the <i>s</i> option, lays out the memory usage statistics much like the <i>proc</i> command. Here is an example</p>

<pre>$ vmstat -s
      8167848 K total memory
      7449376 K used memory
      3423872 K active memory
      3140312 K inactive memory
       718472 K free memory
      1154464 K buffer memory
      2422876 K swap cache
      1998844 K total swap
            0 K used swap
      1998844 K free swap
       392650 non-nice user cpu ticks

   1382755972 boot time
         8567 forks
$</pre>
<p>The top few lines indicate total memory, free memory etc and so on.</p>

<h3>4. top command</h3>

<p>The top command is generally used to check memory and cpu usage per process. However it also reports total memory usage and can be used to monitor the total RAM usage. The header on output has the required information. Here is a sample output</p>

<pre>top - 15:20:30 up  6:57,  5 users,  load average: 0.64, 0.44, 0.33
Tasks: 265 total,   1 running, 263 sleeping,   0 stopped,   1 zombie
%Cpu(s):  7.8 us,  2.4 sy,  0.0 ni, 88.9 id,  0.9 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
KiB Mem:   8167848 total,  6642360 used,  1525488 free,  1026876 buffers
KiB Swap:  1998844 total,        0 used,  1998844 free,  2138148 cached

<p>Check the KiB Mem and KiB Swap lines on the header. They indicate total, used and free amounts of the memory. The buffer and cache information is present here too, like the free command.</p>

<h3>5. htop</h3>

<p>Similar to the top command, the htop command also shows memory usage along with various other details.</p>

<p>The header on top shows cpu usage along with RAM and swap usage with the corresponding figures.</p>

<h3>RAM Information</h3>

<p>To find out hardware information about the installed RAM, use the demidecode command. It reports lots of information about the installed RAM memory.</p>

<pre>$ sudo dmidecode -t 17
# dmidecode 2.11
SMBIOS 2.4 present.
