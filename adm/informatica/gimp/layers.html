<h1>Layers</h1>

<p>You can picture layers as independent sheets of paper, all piled up on top of each other.</p>

<h2>Alpha Channels</h2>

<p><i>Alpha</i> is a fancy term in the graphics gergon to mean <i>transparency</i>. <i>Add Alpha Channel</i> makes the layer capable of using transparency. It doesn't make anything transparent immediately, but if you <i>Edit</i> ⟶ <i>Clear</i>, or use tools such as the Erase, you will create transparent areas instead of white.</p>

<p>An alpha channel is automatically added into the Channel Dialog as soon as you add a second layer to your image. Gimp deals with transparency by allowing a fourth channel to be included with each layer of an image. The alpha channel is an 8-bit maks (i.e, each pixel can be one of 256 values) that indicated the translucency of the pixels on the underlying image layer.</p>
