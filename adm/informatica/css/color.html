<h1>Color Properties</h1>

<p>There are two <b>color</b> properties</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><code>color</code>: specifies the color of an element’s text.</p></li>
	<li><p><code>background-color</code>: specifies the background color of an element.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There’s quite a bit of flexibility when it comes to specifying color values. You can specify a color value using one of five different formats. We’ll describe the formats in detail, but first, here’s
a teaser of what you can look forward to:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>color name—for example, red, green, etc;</p></li>
	<li><p>RGB value—specifies amounts of red, green, and blue</p></li>
</ul>

<pre>
&lt;style&gt;
	.roofColor {color: darkslategray;}
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>

<h2>RGB Values for Color</h2>

<p>RGB stands for red, green, and blue. An RGB value specifies the amounts of red, green, and blue that mix together to form the displayed color. To specify an amount of a color, you can use a percentage,
an integer, or a hexadecimal number (we’ll explain hexadecimal shortly). We’ll provide explanations and examples coming up, but for now, here are the allowable ranges for each technique:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>percentage—0% to 100% for each color;</p></li>
	<li><p>integer—0 to 255 for each color;</p></li>
	<li><p>hexadecimal—00 to ff for each color;</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>RGB Values with Percentages</h3>

<p>To specify an RGB value with percentages, use this format:</p>

<pre>rgb(red-percent, green-percent, blue-percent)</pre>

<p>Each percent value must be between 0% and 100%. Here’s an example class selector rule that uses an RGB value with percentages:</p>

<pre>&lt;style&gt;
.eggplant {background-color: rgb(52%,20%,45%);}
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>

<h3>RGB Values with Integers</h3>

<p>To specify an RGB value with integers, use this format:</p>

<pre>rgb(red-integer,green-integer,blue-integer)</pre>

<p>Each integer value must be between 0 and 255, with 0 providing the least intensity and 255 providing the most. Here are two class selector rules that use RGB values with integers:</p>

<pre>&lt;style&gt;
.favorite1 {color: rgb(144,238,144);}
.favorite2 {color: rgb(127,127,127);}
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>

<h3>RGB Values with Hexadecimal</h3>

<p>With many programming languages, including HTML and CSS, numbers can be represented not only with base-10 decimal numbers, but also with base-16 hexadecimal (hex) numbers. A number system’s “base” indicates the number of unique symbols in the number system. So base 10 (for the decimal number system) means there are 10 unique symbols—0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. And base 16 (for the hexadecimal number system) means there are 16 unique symbols—0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. When specifying an RGB color value, you have choices. You can use percentages or standard integers as described earlier, or you can use hexadecimal values. For hexadecimal RGB values, you’ll need to use the format #rrggbb where:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>rr = two hexadecimal digits that specify the amount of red</p></li>
	<li><p>gg = two hexadecimal digits that specify the amount of green</p></li>
	<li><p>bb = two hexadecimal digits that specify the amount of blue</p></li>
</ul>

<p>With the percentage and integer RGB values, a smaller number for a particular color means less of that color. Likewise, with hexadecimal RGB values, a smaller number means less of a particular color. The smallest hexadecimal digit is 0, so 00 represents the absence of a particular color. If all col- ors are absent, that’s black. Therefore, #000000 (00 for each of the three colors) indicates black. The
largest hexadecimal digit is f, so ff represents the greatest intensity of a particular color. If all colors are maximally intense, that’s white. Therefore, #ffffff (ff for each of the three colors) indicates white. So you now know how to make black and white using hexadecimal numbers. Those are easy. Using hexadecimal numbers that are between the two extremes is a bit trickier. What color does
the following value represent?</p>

<pre>#ffbbbb</pre>

<p>Note <i>ff</i> for the first two digits. The first two digits are for red, so #ffbbbb is a shade of red. Light red or dark red? To figure that out, you need to know whether the other two colors are less than or greater than halfway between 00 and ff. The other two colors both have values of bb. The b hex digit (which represents eleven) is closer to f (which represents fifteen) than 0, so the other two
colors are closer to white than black. That means #ffbbbb is light red (otherwise known as pink).<br> Here’s an example CSS rule with a hexadecimal RGB value:</p>

<pre>&lt;style&gt;
.sapphire {background-color: #0f42ba;}
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>

<p>In the #0f42ba color value, which is the most intense—red, green, or blue? The red portion’s value, 0f, has an f in it, and we know f represents fifteen, so maybe red is the most intense? No. With good
old-fashioned base-10 decimal numbers, 09 is a small number (as compared to, say, 95) because digits at the left (0 in this case) have greater significance than digits at the right (9 in this case). It’s the same in the hexadecimal number system. The red portion of #0f42ba is 0f, and now we know that 0f is a small number; consequently, there’s very little red in the resulting color. The green portion of #0f42ba is 42, and 42 is a relatively small number; consequently, there’s not much green in the resulting color. The blue portion of #0f42ba is ba, and ba is a relatively large number; 6 consequently, there’s quite a bit of blue in the resulting color.</p>

<p>The W3C’s CSS3 standard says that RGB hexadecimal digits are case insensitive. So in this example, #0F42BA (with uppercase F, B, and A) would also work. You’ll see lowercase and uppercase on the W3C site and in the real world. Use lowercase to be consistent with standard HTML coding conventions, which say to use lowercase values unless there’s a reason to do otherwise. But if you’re reading this book as part of a course, and your teacher says to use uppercase hexadecimal digits, then use uppercase hexadecimal digits.</p>

<h2>Opacity Values for Color</h2>

<p>In the previous section, you learned how to produce a color by using the rgb construct with values for red, green, and blue. In this section, you’ll learn how to produce a partially transparent color by using the rgba construct with values for red, green, blue, and opacity. The fourth value, opacity, determines how opaque the color is, where opaque refers to the inability to see through something. It’s the opposite of transparency. If the opacity value is 100%, that means the color is completely opaque, and if there is content behind the color, that content gets covered up. At the other extreme, if the opacity value is 0%, that means the color is completely transparent. The A in RGBA stands for alpha. Why alpha? There’s no official documentation on alpha’s etymology, but perhaps the CSS3 standards people chose it simply because it’s the first letter in the Greek alphabet. <br> To specify an RGBA value, use one of these two formats:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>rgba(red-integer,green-integer,blue-integer,opacity-number-between-0-and-1)</p></li>
	<li><p>rgba(red-percent,green-percent,blue-percent,opacity-number-between-0-and-1)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For both formats, the fourth value specifies the opacity. The opacity value must be in the form of a decimal number between 0 and 1, with 0 being completely transparent, 1 being completely opaque, and .5 in between. For the first format, each integer value must be between 0 and 255, with 0 providing the least intensity and 255 providing the most. That should sound familiar because that was also the case
for integers with the rgb construct. For the second format, each percent value must be between 0% and 100%.</p>

<p>You can use the rgba construct with the <code>color</code> property, which specifies the color of an element’s foreground (e.g., text). However, it’s more common to use it with the background-color
property, as you will see in the following example</p>

<pre>.yellow-bg2 {background-color: rgba(255,255,0,.4);}</pre>

<p>As an alternative to using <code>rgba</code>, you can use <code>rgb</code> in conjunction with the <code>opacity</code> property. Here’s the third class selector rule from the Opacity Example web page:</p>

<pre>.yellow-bg3 {background-color: rgb(255,255,0); opacity: .4;}</pre>
