<h1>Namespaces</h1>

<p>When an application is developed by several programmers working in parallel and/or when it incorporates headers and source code from various third-party C++ libraries, using namespaces to prevent name clashes becomes essentials. A <b>namespace</b> is a block that attaches an extra name −the namespace name − to every entity name that is declared or defined within it. The full name of each entity is the mamespace name followed by the scope resolution operator, ::, followed by the basic entity name. Differene namespaces can contain entities with the same name, but the entities are differentiated because they are qualified by different namespace names.  <br> You typically use a separate namespace within a signle program for each collection of code that encompasses a common purpose. Each namespace would represent some logical grouping of functions, together with any related global variables and declariation. A namespace would also be used to contain a unit of release, such a library. </p>

<pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
	std::cout<<"Hello World"&lt;&lt;std::endl;
	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>Writing long programs with name of the name space followed by the scope resolution operator may be tedious. C++ gives an easier option, by writing following the preprocessor include directive, the following line:</p>

<pre>using namespace std;</pre>

<p>This statement will inform the compiler that unless otherwise mentioned, any resource may be treated to be from namespace <i>std</i>.</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	std::cout<<"Hello World"&lt;&lt;std::endl;
	return 0;
}
</pre>
