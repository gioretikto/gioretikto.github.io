<h1>Stacking terms</h1>

<p>In many applications, like in chemical reactions, two terms often need to be stacked (to put one above another), where the upper term is usually some texts and lower one is a symbol covering the upper term. Generally stacking is done through the \stackrel{aup}{alow}, where aup is the upper term and alow is the lower one. Some applications of this command are shown in Table 12.13, where arrow symbols are generated through fixed-length.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>A \stackrel{a} {\rightarrow} B</p></li>
	<li><p>\mathrm{2Na + D_2} \stackrel{\mathrm{heat}} {\longrightarrow} \mathrm{2NaD}</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The stacking under \stackrel{}{] may look odd if the length of the term is too long or short in comparison to that of the covering symbol.</p>
