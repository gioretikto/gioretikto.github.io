<h1>Variables</h1>

<p>To use a variable, you've first got to create it — more accurately, we call this declaring the variable. To do this, we type the keyword var or let followed by the name you want to call your variable:</p>

<pre>
let myName;
let myAge;
</pre>

<h2>Initializing a variable</h2>

<p>Once you've declared a variable, you can initialize it with a value. You do this by typing the variable name, followed by an equals sign (=), followed by the value you want to give it. For example:</p>

<pre>
myName = 'Chris';
myAge = 37;
</pre>

<h2>Dynamic typing</h2>

<p>JavaScript is a "dynamically typed language", which means that, unlike some other languages, you don't need to specify what data type a variable will contain (numbers, strings, arrays, etc).</p>

<p>For example, if you declare a variable and give it a value enclosed in quotes, the browser treats the variable as a string:</p>

<h2>Variable types</h2>

<p>There are a few different types of data we can store in variables. In this section we'll describe these in brief, then in future articles, you'll learn about them in more detail.</p>

<p>So far we've looked at the first two, but there are others.</p>

<h2>Numbers</h2>

<p>You can store numbers in variables, either whole numbers like 30 (also called integers) or decimal numbers like 2.456 (also called floats or floating point numbers). You don't need to declare variable types in JavaScript, unlike some other programming languages. When you give a variable a number value, you don't include quotes:</p>

<pre>let myAge = 17;</pre>

<h2>Strings</h2>

<p>Strings are pieces of text. In JavaScript, string literals are represented with sinle quote, double quote, or backticks. The backtick was introduced in ES6 to enable <a href="template_literals.html">template strings</a>.</p>

<pre>let dolphinGoodbye = 'So long and thanks for all the fish';</pre>

<h2>Escaping</h2>

<p>What if you want to use quotes <i>in</i> a string? To solve this problem, there needs to be a method of <i>escaping</i> characters so they are not taken as string termination. Consider the following examples (which do not require escaping"):</p>

<pre>
const dialog = 'Sam looked up, and said "Hello World!", as Max walked in';
const imperative ="Don't do that!";
</pre>

<p>In <code>dialog</code>, we can use double quotes without fear because our string is set off with single quotes. Likewise, in <code>imperative</code>, we can use an apostrophe because the string is set off with double quotes. But what if we needed to use both? Consider:</p>

<pre>
// this will produce error
const dialog = "Sam look up and said "don't do that!" to Max";
</pre>

<p>We must <i>escape</i> quotation marks with a backlash (\) to singal to JavaScript that the string is <i>not</i> ending. Here's the preceding example rewritten to use both types of quatation marks:</p>

<pre>
const dialog1 = "He looked up and said \"don't do that!\" to Max.";
const dialog2 = 'He looked up and said "don\'t do that!\" to Max.';
</pre>

<p>The, of course, we get into the chicken-and-egg problem that arises when we want to use a backlash in our string. To solve this problem, a backlash can escape itself:</p>

<pre>const t = "In JavaScript, use \\ as an escape character in strings";</pre>


<p>Wheter you use single or double quotes is up to you. I generally prefer double quotation marks when I'm writing text that might be presented to the user, because I use contractions (like <i>don't</i>) more ofter than I use double quotation marks. When expressing HTML inside a JavaScript string, it is preferrable to use single quotation marks so that double quotation marks can be use for attribute values.</p>

<h2>Booleans</h2>

<p>Booleans are true/false values — they can have two values, true or false. These are generally used to test a condition, after which code is run as appropriate. So for example, a simple case would be:</p>

<pre>let iAmAlive = true;</pre>

<p>Whereas in reality it would be used more like this:</p>

<pre>let test = 6 &lt; 3;</pre>

<p>This is using the "less than" operator (<) to test whether 6 is less than 3. As you might expect, it returns false, because 6 is not less than 3! You will learn a lot more about such operators later on in the course.</p>

<h1>Reference Types</h1>

<h2>Arrays</h2>

<p>An array is a single object that contains multiple values enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas. Try entering the following lines into your console:</p>

<pre>
let myNameArray = ['Chris', 'Bob', 'Jim'];
let myNumberArray = [10, 15, 40];
</pre>

<p>Once these arrays are defined, you can access each value by their location within the array. Try these lines:</p>

<pre>
myNameArray[0]; // should return 'Chris'
myNumberArray[2]; // should return 40
</pre>

<p>The square brackets specify an index value corresponding to the position of the value you want returned. You might have noticed that arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed: the first element is at index 0.</p>

<h2>Objects</h2>

<p>In programming, an object is a structure of code that models a real-life object. You can have a simple object that represents a box and contains information about its width, length, and height, or you could have an object that represents a person, and contains data about their name, height, weight, what language they speak, how to say hello to them, and more.</p>

<p>Try entering the following line into your console:</p>

<pre>let dog = { name : 'Spot', breed : 'Dalmatian' };</pre>

<p>To retrieve the information stored in the object, you can use the following syntax:</p>

<pre>dog.name</pre>

<p>We won't be looking at objects any more for now — you can learn more about those in a future module.</p>

<p>special operator called <code>typeof</code> — this returns the data type of the variable you type after it.</p>

<h2>Constants in JavaScript</h2>

<p>Many programming languages have the concept of a constant — a value that once declared can't be changed. There are many reasons why you'd want to do this, from security (if a third party script changed such values it could cause problems) to debugging and code comprehension (it is harder to accidentally change values that shouldn't be changed and mess things up).</p>

<p>In the early days of JavaScript, constants didn't exist. In modern JavaScript, we have the keyword const, which lets us store values that can never be changed:</p>

<pre>
const daysInWeek = 7;
const hoursInDay = 24;
</pre>

<p>const works in exactly the same way as let, except that you can't give a const a new value. In the following example, the second line would throw an error:</p>

<pre>
const daysInWeek = 7;
daysInWeek = 8;
</pre>
