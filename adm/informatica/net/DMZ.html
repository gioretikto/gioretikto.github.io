<h1>DeMilitarized Zone (DMZ)</h1>

<p>A demilitarized zone (DMZ), also known as a screened subnet, allows an organization to give external hosts limited access to public resources, such as a company website, without granting them acess to the internal network. It essentially involves setting up two <a href="firewall.html">firewalls</a>: one outer and one inner. Resources that must be accessible to the</p>

<figcaption>Since the public servers are Web, e-mail, and FTP, HTTP, DNS, and SMPT traffic will be permitted to reach the DMZ zone − everything else will be denied</figcaption>

<p>The outer firewall is more permissive, and the inner firewall is highly restrictive. A truly secure firewall would deny all access to any PCs or services running on the LAN. But that is not always possible if you want to set up an e-mail, Web or FTP server for outside access. There are basically two ways to open up your network and still keep it secure: You can set up a DMS, or you can use filtering.  <br> In this case, the hosts most vulnerable to attack are those that provide services to users outside of the local area network, such as e-mail, Web and Domain Name System (DNS) servers. Because of the increased potential of these hosts suffering an attack, they are placed into this specific subnetwork in order to protect the rest of the network in case any of them become compromised. </p>
