<h1>UDP</h1>

<p>The <b>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</b> is a connectionless, best effort, non-error checking trasport protocol. Where TCP guarantees delivery, UDP does not guarantee delivery.<br> UDP has no handshake, session, or reliability: it is informally called “Send and Pray” for this reason. UDP was developed in recognition of the fact that some applications may require small pieces of information to be transferred, and the use of a connection-oriented protocol would result in a significant ovehead to the transfer of data. UDP transmits a piece of information referred to as UDP datagram without first establishing a connection to the receiver, the portocol is also referred to as a best-effort protocol.</p>

<p>UDP does not add flow control overhead because</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>UDP is connectionless, there's no need to send segments to do a three-way handshake, to establish a connection;</p></li>
	<li><p>UDP makes no use of sequencing;</p></li>
	<li><p>UDP does not send acknowledgments;</p></li>
	<li><p>UDP does not guarantee reception of data segments.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Consequently UPD is faster than TCP an ca be good enough in some data-transfer scenario such as DNA lookups and TFTP transfers.</p>
