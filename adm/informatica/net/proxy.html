<h1>Proxy server</h1>

<p>The second very common type of defensive device is a <b>proxy server.</b> A proxy server will almost always be another computer. You might see the same machine used as both a proxy server and a <a href="firewall.html">firewall</a>. A proxy server’s purpose is quite simple: It hides your entire network from the outside world. People trying to investigate your network from the outside will see only the proxy server. They will not see the actual machines on your network. When packets go out of your network, their headers are changed so that the packets have the return address of the proxy server. Conversely, the only way you can access the outside world is via the proxy server. A proxy server combined with a firewall is basic network security. It would frankly be negligent to ever run a network that did not have a firewall and proxy server. </p>
