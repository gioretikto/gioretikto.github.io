<h1>Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)</h1>

<p>The IPSect protocol suite is a collection of security protocols that can be applied to protect network traffic at the IP layer. IPsec protocol suite is divided into two main protocols</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Authentication Header (AH) protocol: it provides authentication, data integrity, but no confidentiality (i.e., no data encryption);</p></li>
	<li><p>The Encapsulation protocol Security Plaload (ESP).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A ‘‘connection’’ in the context of IPsec is called an <b>SA (Security Association)</b>. An SA is a simplex connection between two endpoints and has a security identifier associated with it. If secure traffic is needed in both directions, two security associations are required. Security identifiers are carried in packets traveling on these secure connections and are used to look up keys and other relevant information when a secure packet arrives.</p>

<h2>Authentication Header (AH)</h2>

<p>AH protocol provides source authentication and data integrity but not confidential-ity. This is done by a source that wants to send a datagram first establishing an SA, through which the source can send the datagram. A source datagram includes an AH inserted between the original IP datagram data and the IP header to shield the data field,  which  is  now  encapsulated  as  a  standard  IP  datagram.  See  Fig. 17.5.  Upon  receipt  of  the  IP  datagram,  the  destination  host  notices  the  AH  and  processes  it using the AH protocol. Intermediate hosts such as routers, however, do their usual job of examining every datagram for the destination IP address and then forward-ing it on.</p>

<h2>Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)</h2>

<p>Unlike the AH protocol, ESP protocol provides source authentication, data integrity, and  confidentiality.  This  has  made  ESP  the  most  commonly  used  IPsec  header.  Similar to AH, ESP begins with the source host establishing an AS that it uses to send  secure  datagrams  to  the  destination.  Datagrams  are  secured  by  ESP  by  sur-rounding their original IP datagrams with a new header and trailer fields all encap-sulated  into  a  new  IP  datagram.  See  Fig. 17.6.  Confidentiality  is  provided  by  DES_CBC encryption. The ESP Authentication Data field is next to the ESP trailer field on the datagram.</p>
