<h1>Bluetooth</h1>

<p>The <b>Bluetooth</b> protocol architecture is another specification for wireless devices that is gaining popularity throughout the networking industry. Bluetooth was developed by IBM and a group of other companies. Like 802.11, the Bluetooth standard defines the OSI Data Link and Physical layers (equivalent to the TCP/IP Network Access layer).</p>

<p>Although the Bluetooth standard is often used for peripheral devices such as headsets and wireless keyboards, Bluetooth is also used in place of 802.11 in some cases, and Bluetooth backers are always eager to state that some of the security problems related to 802.11 do not apply to Bluetooth. However, IBM’s official line is that Bluetooth and 802.11 are “complementary technologies.” Whereas 802.11 is
designed to provide an equivalent to Ethernet for wireless networks, Bluetooth focuses on providing a reliable and high-performing environment for wireless devices operating in a short range (10 meters). Bluetooth is designed to facilitate communication among a group of interacting wireless devices in a small work area defined within the Bluetooth specification as a Personal Area Network (PAN). Like other wireless forms, Bluetooth uses an access point to connect the wireless network to a conventional network. (The access point is known as a Network Access Point, or NAP in Bluetooth terminology.) The Bluetooth Encapsulation Protocol encapsulates TCP/IP packets for distribution for delivery over the Bluetooth network. Of course, if a Bluetooth device is to be accessible through the Internet, it must be
accessible through TCP/IP. Vendors envision a class of Internet-ready Bluetooth devices accessible through a Bluetooth-enabled Internet bridge (see Figure 9.18). A Bluetooth NAP device acts as a network bridge, receiving incoming TCP/IP transmissions and replacing the incoming Network Access layer with the Bluetooth network access protocols for delivery to a waiting device.</p>

<footer>Bluetooth is named for the Viking King Harald Bluetooth, who ruled Denmark and Norway in the eleventh century. King Harald is famous for converting to Christianity after watching a German priest succeed with a miraculous dare.</footer>
