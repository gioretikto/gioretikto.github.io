<h1>IPv6</h1>

<p>The world is running out of available <a href="IPv4.html">IPv4</a> addresses (a 32-bit system). At 32 bits, the IPv4 address space is 2<sup>32</sup>, or 4,294,967,296 possible addresses (a little over 4 billion networked devices). <br> <b>Internet Protocol version 6</b> (IPv6) is a 128-bit number (for four times as large as the IPv4 address space) identifying an endpoint in a TCP/IP communication. This means that with IPv6 we can assign 2<sup>128</sup> addresses approximately 10<sup>38</sup> individual machines (devices).  <br> In contrast to IPv4, IPv6 uses a hexadecimal representation, eight groups of 16 bits each, separating the groups by a colon ( : ). An example of an IPv6 address is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>1001: 0db8: 0000: 0000: 0000: ff00: 0023: 7219</p>
</div>

<p>There are a few rules for shortening IPv6 addresses, such as removing leading zeros or compressing consecutive sections of zeros by replacing them with two colons ( :: ). <br> For example, the IPv6 loopback address can be written abbreviated as ::1 (the IPv4 variant would be 127.0.0.1 ). Just like IPv4, IPv6 has a number of special and reserved addresses; see APNIC’s listing of IPv6 address types for examples. It’s important to note that IPv4 and IPv6 are not compatible. This means that IPv6 support needs to be built into each and every network participant, from edge devices (like your phone) to routers to server software. This IPv6 support has, at least in the context of Linux, already shown to be pretty wide. For example, the ip addr command we saw in the section “IPv4” on page 153 would already by default show us the IPv6 addresses. </p>

<p>Let's look at a list of the most important features of IPv6:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><b>Large address space</b>: IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses;</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Enhanced security</b>: IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) is integrated into IPv6 as part of the protocol. This means that two devices can dynamically create a secure tunnel withou user intervention.</p></li>

	<li><p><b>Header improvements</b>: The packet header used in IPv6 is simpler than the one used in IPv4. The IPv6 header is not protected by a checksum, so routers do not need to calculate a checksum for each packet;</p></li>
	<li><p><b>No NAT</b>: Since each device has a globally unique IPv6 address, there is no need for <a href="NAT.html">NAT</a>;</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Automatic configuration of stateless</b> addresses: IPv6 devices can be automatically configured with an IPv6 address.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>IPSec and IPv6</h2>

<p>IPSec is a mandatory component for IPv6. and is used to natively protect IPv6 data as it is sent over the network. The components of IPSec in IPv6 are not dramatically different from the [PSec that industry has been using since the 1990s. In IPv6, IPSec uses the AH authentication header and the ESP extension header.<br> The IPv6 IPSec is a set of Internet standards that uses cryptographic security services to provide the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><b>Confidentiality</b>—IPSec traffic is encrypted and cannot be deciphered without the appropriate encryption key. This should be easier to use in conjunction with IPv6, since it’s a native component of the protocol.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Data origin authentication</b>—Ipv6 IPSec uses a cryptographic checksum that incorporates a shared encryption key so that the receiver can verify that it was actually sent by the apparent sender. This prevents spoofing of transactions.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Data integrity</b>—The cryptographic checksum can also be used by the receiver to verify that the packet was not modified in transit.</p></li>
</ul>
