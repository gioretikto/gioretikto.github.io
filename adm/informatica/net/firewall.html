<h1>Firewall</h1>

<p>A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet. A firewall is, in essence, a barrier between two computers or computer systems. The most common place to encounter a firewall is between your network and the outside world. However, firewalls on individual computers and between network segments are also quite common. At a minimum, a firewall will filter incoming packets based on certain parameters such as packet size, source IP address, protocol, and destination port. Linux and Windows (beginning with Windows XP and in all subsequent Windows versions) ship with a simple firewall. For Windows, the firewall in Windows 7 was expanded to handle filtering both inbound and outbound traffic. Windows 8 and Windows 10 have not significantly changed the firewall functionality in Windows. You should turn on and configure your
individual computer firewalls in addition to perimeter firewalls.</p>

<p>Firewalls are categorized as a network-based or a host-based system. Network-based firewalls are positioned between two or more networks, typically between the local area network (LAN) and wide area network (WAN), their basic function is to control the flow of data between connected networks. They are either a software appliance running on general-purpose hardware, a hardware appliance running on special-purpose hardware.</p>

<p>There are numerous types of firewalls and variations on those types. But most firewalls can be grouped into one of the following three families of firewalls.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Packet inspection</p></li>
	<li><p>Stateful packet inspection</p></li>
	<li><p>Application</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Packet filter</h2>

<p>The first reported type of network firewall is called a <b>packet filter</b>, which inspects packets transferred between computers. The firewall maintains an access-control list which dictates what packets will be looked at and what action should be applied, if any, with the default action set to silent discard. Three basic actions regarding the packet consist of a silent discard, discard with <a href="ICMP.html">Internet Control Message Protocol</a> or TCP reset response to the sender, and forward to the next hop. Packets may be filtered by source and destination IP addresses, protocol, source and destination ports. The bulk of Internet communication in 20th and early 21st century used either Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) in conjunction with well-known ports, enabling firewalls of that era to distinguish between specific types of traffic such as web browsing, remote printing, email transmission, and file transfers.</p>

<p>For example, it is common for a packet filtering firewall to ask three questions:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Is this packet using a protocol that the firewall allows?</p></li>
	<li><p>Is this packet destined for a port that the firewall allows?</p></li>
	<li><p>Is the packet coming from an IP address that the firewall has not blocked?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Those are three very basic rules. Some packet filter firewalls have additional rules to check. But what is not checked is the preceding packets from that same source. Essentially, each packet is treated as a singular event without reference to the preceding conversation. That makes packet filtering firewalls quite susceptible to some DoS attacks, such as SYN floods.</p>

<h2 id="SPI">Stateful Packet Inspection</h2>

<p>The Malwarebytes firewall will examine each packet, denying or permitting access based not only on the examination of the current packet, but also on data derived from previous packets in the conversation. This means that the firewall is aware of the context in which a specific packet was sent. This makes these firewalls far less susceptible to ping floods and SYN floods, as well as less susceptible to spoofing. For example, if the firewall detects that the current packet is an ICMP packet and a stream of several thousand packets have been continuously coming from the same source IP, it is clearly a DoS attack and the packets will be blocked. The SPI firewall can also look at the actual contents of the packet, which allows for some very advanced filtering capabilities. Most high-end firewalls use the stateful packet inspection method;
when possible, this is the recommended type of firewall.</p>

<h2>Application Gateway</h2>

<p>An application gateway (also known as application proxy or application-level proxy) is a program that runs on a firewall. When a client program, such as a web browser, establishes a connection to a destination service, such as a web server, it connects to an application gateway, or proxy. The client then negotiates with the proxy server in order to gain access to the destination service. In effect, the proxy establishes the connection with the destination behind the firewall and acts on behalf of the client, hiding and protecting individual computers on the network behind the firewall. This process actually creates two connections. There is one connection between the client and the proxy server and another connection between the proxy server and the destination. Once a connection is established, the application gateway makes all decisions about which packets to forward. Since all communication is conducted through the proxy server, computers behind the firewall are protected. Essentially, an application firewall is one that is used for specific types of applications such as database or web server. It is able to examine the protocol being used (such as HTTP) for any anomalous behavior and block traffic that might get past other types of firewalls. It is common to have an application firewall that also includes stateful packet inspection.</p>

<h2>Content Filtering</h2>

<p>Most people think of a firewall as a tool for preventing outside access to your LAN, but it can also serve to control what your internal users access on the Internet. For a home installation, these tools are a great way to protect your kids from viewing objectionable material.</p>
