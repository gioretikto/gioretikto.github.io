<h1>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</h1>

<p>SMTP is an application layer protocol with regard to the (OSI) model. It is used to send e-mail messages over the Internet. This protocol establishes a link from an e-mail client and a mail server. Receipt of e-mail is handled by another protocol POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) or IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol). Some characteristics of SMTP are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>It allows reliable data transfer built on top of TCP (on port 25);</p></li>

	<li><p>It is a <b>Push protocol</b> where the sending server pushes the file to the receiving server (contrary to HTTP which is mainly a <b>pull protocol</b>—someone loads information on a Web server and users use HTTP)</p></li>

	<li><p>It is a Command/response interaction where command are ASCII text and responses are three-digit status code and phrase.</p></li>

	<li><p>It is Synchronous as the sender awaits a response before issuing the next command.</p></li>

	<li><p>It has three phases: Handshking, Transfer of messages, and Closure.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>SMTP protocol does not require authentication. This allows anyone on the Internet to send email to anyone else or even to large groups of people. It is this characteristi of SMTP that makes junk email or spam possible.</p>

<h3 id="fields">Mail fields</h3>

<p>The <b>To</b> field is generally for the main recipients of your email.<br> <b>Cc</b> stands for carbon copy which means that whose address appears after the Cc: header would receive a copy of the message. Also, the Cc header would also appear inside the header of the received message.</p>

<b>To vs. CC</b>: The To and CC fields work similarly. Whether you put four email addresses in the To field or put one email address in the To field and three in the CC field, the four people will all receive the same email. They’ll also be able to see the email address of every other recipients in the To and CC fields.<br> 

<p><b>Bcc</b> stands for blind carbon copy which is similar to that of Cc except that the Email address of the recipients specified in this field do not appear in the received message header and the recipients in the <b>To</b> or <b>Cc</b> fields will not know that a copy sent to these address.</p>

<h2 id="pop">(POP3) and IMAP</h2>

<p>To retrieve their incoming messages from a server, clients use one of two "<b>pull</b>" protocols: <b>Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3)</b> or <b>Internet Message Access Protocol version 4 (IMAP4)</b>. Normally, this protocol uses the TCP port number 110 for connecting to the POP3 server. </p>

<p>An IMAP server typically listens on port number 143. IMAP over SSL/TLS (IMAPS) is assigned the port number 993. IMAP supports polling and notifications. The server sends a notification to a client to inform them that there is data available. This allows flexible retrieval of messages and give the client the control of whether or not to download new message data.</p>

<h3>Mail storage</h3>

<p>POP users typically retrieve their messages from the server and then immediately delete the messages from the server. Long-term archival of messages occurs on client systems. IMAP, on the other hand, was designed to enable users to store messages in folders on the IMAP server computer. As a result, an IMPA server may need to devote more disk space to user mail directories than a POP server. One bid advantage to IMAP's system is that it enables users to access mail using different mail client program or even different computers, without having to copy mail files between systems.</p>

<h3>Partial Retrieval Options</h3>

<p>POP mail retrieval is all-or-none. Clients can either retrieve a message in its entirely or leave the message on the server. IMAP is more flexible; it supports retrieving various parts of a message, such as its header separately from its body. Therefore, with IMAP, users can delete messages they know they don't want without retrieving the bulk of the message text. With obvious spams and worms, this feature can save your network substantial amounts of bandwidth.</p>
