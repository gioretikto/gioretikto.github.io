<h1>How to Wrap Text Around an Image</h1>

<p>What you do here is use the CSS "float" property, which will pull the image from normal document flow (the way that image would normally display, with the text 
aligned beneath it) and it will align it to the left side of its container. The text that comes after it in the HTML markup with now wrap around it. 
We also added some padding values so that this text would not but directly up against the image. Instead, it will have some nice spacing that will be visually
 attractive in the page's design. In the CSS shorthand for padding, we added 0 values to the top and left side of the image, and 20 pixels to its left and bottom.
 Remember, you need to add some padding the right side of a left aligned image. A right aligned image (which we will look at in a moment) would have padding applied
 to its left side.</p>

<p>The HTML part:</p>

<pre>
&lt;img class="left" src="img/prop21.png" alt="proposition 21 I book"/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the sum of BA and AC is greater than the sum of BE and EC. Again, since, in the triangle CED, the sum of the two sides
 CE and ED is greater than CD, add DB to each, therefore the sum of CE and EB is greater than the sum of CD and DB.
But the sum of BA and AC was proved greater than the sum of BE and EC, therefore the sum of BA and AC is much greater than the sum of BD and DC.
Again, since in any triangle the exterior angle is greater than the interior and opposite angle, therefore, in the triangle CDE,
 the exterior angle BDC is greater than the angle CED.
For the same reason, moreover, in the triangle ABE the exterior angle CEB is greater than the angle BAC. But the angle BDC was proved greater 
than the angle CEB,  therefore the angle BDC is much greater than the angle BAC. □&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<p>The CSS part:</p>

<pre>
.left{
 float: left;
 padding: 0 20px 20px 0;
}
</pre>
