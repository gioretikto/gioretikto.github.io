<h1>Self Referential Structures</h1>

<p>Self Referential structures are those structures that have one or more pointers which point to the same type of structure, as their member.</p>

<img src="img/selfrefstruct.png" alt="Self Referential Structures"/>

<p>In other words, structures pointing to the same type of structures are self-referential in nature.</p>

<p>Types of Self Referential Structures

<ol>
    <li><p>Self Referential Structure with Single Link</p></li>
    <li><p>Self Referential Structure with Multiple Links</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>Self Referential Structure with Single Link</b>: These structures can have only one self-pointer as their member. The following example will show us how to connect the objects of a self-referential structure with the single link and access the corresponding data members. The connection formed is shown in the following figure.</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  
struct node { 
    int data1; 
    char data2; 
    struct node* link; 
}; 
  
int main() 
{ 
    struct node ob1; // Node1 
  
    // Intialization 
    ob1.link = NULL; 
    ob1.data1 = 10; 
    ob1.data2 = 20; 
  
    struct node ob2; // Node2 
  
    // Initialization 
    ob2.link = NULL; 
    ob2.data1 = 30; 
    ob2.data2 = 40; 
  
    // Linking ob1 and ob2 
    ob1.link = &ob2; 
  
    // Accessing data members of  ob2 using ob1 
    printf("%d", ob1.link->data1); 
    printf("\n%d", ob1.link->data2); 
    return 0; 
} 
</pre>

<p>output</p>

<pre>
30
40
</pre>

<p><b>Self Referential Structure with Multiple Links</b>: Self referential structures with multiple links can have more than one self-pointers. Many complicated data structures can be easily constructed using these structures. Such structures can easily connect to more than one nodes at a time. The following example shows one such structure with more than one links.</p>

<p>The connections made in the above example can be understood using the following figure.</p>

<img src="img/multiple_links.png" alt="multiple links"/>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h>&gt;

struct node { 
	int data; 
	struct node* prev_link; 
	struct node* next_link; 
}; 

int main() 
{ 
	struct node ob1; // Node1 

	// Intialization 
	ob1.prev_link = NULL; 
	ob1.next_link = NULL; 
	ob1.data = 10; 

	struct node ob2; // Node2 

	// Intialization 
	ob2.prev_link = NULL; 
	ob2.next_link = NULL; 
	ob2.data = 20; 

	struct node ob3; // Node3 

	// Intialization 
	ob3.prev_link = NULL; 
	ob3.next_link = NULL; 
	ob3.data = 30; 

	// Forward links 
	ob1.next_link = &ob2; 
	ob2.next_link = &ob3; 

	// Backward links 
	ob2.prev_link = &ob1; 
	ob3.prev_link = &ob2; 

	// Accessing data of ob1, ob2 and ob3 by ob1 
	printf("%d\t", ob1.data); 
	printf("%d\t", ob1.next_link->data); 
	printf("%d\n", ob1.next_link->next_link->data); 

	// Accessing data of ob1, ob2 and ob3 by ob2 
	printf("%d\t", ob2.prev_link->data); 
	printf("%d\t", ob2.data); 
	printf("%d\n", ob2.next_link->data); 

	// Accessing data of ob1, ob2 and ob3 by ob3 
	printf("%d\t", ob3.prev_link->prev_link->data); 
	printf("%d\t", ob3.prev_link->data); 
	printf("%d", ob3.data); 
	return 0; 
} 
</pre>


<p>Output:</p>

<pre>
10    20    30
10    20    30
10    20    30
</pre>


<p>In the above example we can see that ‘ob1’, ‘ob2’ and ‘ob3’ are three objects of the self referential structure ‘node’. And they are connected using their links in such a way that any of them can easily access each other’s data. This is the beauty of the self referential structures. The connections can be manipulated according to the requirements of the programmer.

<h3>Applications</h3>

<p>Self referential structures are very useful in creation of other complex data structures like:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>Linked Lists</p></li>
    <li><p>Stacks</p></li>
    <li><p>Queues</p></li>
    <li><p>Trees</p></li>
    <li><p>Graphs etc</p></li>
</ul>
