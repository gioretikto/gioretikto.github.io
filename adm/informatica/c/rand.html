<h1>rand()</h1>

<p>The stdlib.h header file provides a <code>rand()</code> function that generates a psuedo-random positive integer when called. This will, by default, return a number in the range from 0 to a large value RAND_MAX (at least 32,767) defined in the headr &lt;stdlib.h&gt;. A specific range can be set by using the modulus operator to specify a maximum upper limit. For example, to specify a range from 0 to 8 with the expression <code>rand() % 9</code>. We use the modulus operator in a way that we get a random number between 0 and 9. To set a minimum lower limit for the range its value can be added to the result of the expression. For example, to specify a range from 1 to 9 with the expression <code>1 + rand() % 9</code>.</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int main()
{
	srand(time (NULL));
	printf("Random number between 0-99 : %d\n", rand()%100);
}
</pre>


<p>If floating random numbers between 0 and 1.0 are desired instead of between 0 and RAND_MAX, the following program is used</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int main()
{
	int i;
	for(i=0; i &lt;10;i++)
		printf("%f\n", 1.0*rand()/RAND_MAX);
	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>The value of rand()/RAND_MAX alone returns 0 as both rand() and RAND_MAX are integers and  the result is truncated integer.</p>

<p>The same numbers are output again and again each time the program is run.</p>

<p>The numbers generated by the rand() function are not truly random as the function successively generates the same sequence of numbers each time a program using rand() is executed. In order to generate a different sequence of numbers the "seed" that starts the sequence must be specified. By default the initial see value is 1 but this can be changed by specifying an alternative integer argument to the <b>srand()</b> function. For example, srand(8). This will cause rand() to generate a different sequence of numbers to those generated using the default seed value but the sequence will still be repeated each time a program using rand() is executed. </p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int main()
{
	int i;
	printf("Enter see integer = ");
	scanf("%d", &i);
	srand(i);
	printf("%d\n", rand());
	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>To generate different random sequences upon successive execution the argument specified to <code>srand()</code> must be something other than a static integer. The common solution is to seed the <b>rand()</b> function with the current time in elapsed seconds with <code>srand(time(NULL))</code>. The function <b>time()</b>, with the argument NULL return the elapsed time since 00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970, measured in seconds.</p>

<p>Now the sequence of numbers generated by rand will be different each time a program using rand() is executed.</p>

<p>Put  <code>srand(time(NULL))</code> <b>at the beginning of file only one time</b></p>

<h2>Monte Carlo Method</h2>

<p>Consider a circle and its circumscribed square. The ratio of the are of the circle to the area of the square is &pi;/4. It is plausible that if points were placed at random in the squarem the fraction &pi;/4 would also lie inside the circle. If that is turee the one could measure &pi;/4 by putting a round cake pan with diameter <i>L</i> inside a square cake pan with side <i>L</i> and collecting rain in both. It is also possible to program a computer to genrate random pairs of Cartesian coordinates to represent random points in the square and count the fraction that lies in the circe. </p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
int main()
{
	int i, count = 0;
	float x,y;
	
	printf("Enter iteration number = ");
	scanf("%d", &n);
	srand(time(NULL));
	for(i=0; i &lt; n; i++)
	{
		x = 1.0 * rand()/RAND_MAX;
		y = 1.0 * rand()/RAND_MAX;
		if(x*x+y*y &lt; 1.0) count = count +1;
	}
	printf("True value = %f\n", PI/4);
	printf("Appx value = %f\n", 1.0* count/n);
	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>where count/n is the fraction of numbers that fell within the circle over the total number of points.</p>
