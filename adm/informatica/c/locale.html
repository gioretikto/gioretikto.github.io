<h1>Locale</h1>

<p>Although ANSI is a U.S. organization, the C Standards Committee endeavored to make the C language as universal as possible. Among the problems it confronted were</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Different alphabets and hence different character sets.</p></li>
	<li><p>Different collating sequences in the character set (the numeric codes for alphabetic characters are not always ordered as they are
in ASCII or EBCDIC).</p></li>
	<li><p>Different methods of representing decimal points (a period in the U.S., but a comma in many European countries).</p></li>
	<li><p>Different ways of displaying times and dates.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A large part of the problem was solved by putting locale-defined behavior into library functions rather than the language itself. For example,
the <code>isalpha()</code> function can return different results depending on what character set is being used. This flexibility, however, raised another problem. If a library function has different interpretations based on locale, how can you force one particular interpretation? Also, how can you find out dynamically, while a program is running, which locale-specific behavior the program will exhibit?</p>

<p>The ANSI Committee solved both of these problems by inventing a function called setlocale(), which enables you to select a specific locale set-
ting or to discover the current locale setting. By changing the locale setting, you can immediately change the action of all relevant functions. Note
that these changes occur at runtime, not at compile time.</p>

<p>The header file associated with setlocale() is <locale.b>. This file contains definitions of at least six macros that enable you to select a particular
part of the C language that you want to affect with the new locale setting:</p>

<pre>
LC_ALL The entire language
LC_COLLATE The strcoll() function
LC_CTYPE All of the character-handling functions
LC_MONETARY _ The monetary formatting information returned by the locale_conv() function
LC_NUMERIC The decimal point character for the formatted I/O and string conversion functions
LC_TIME The strftime() function</pre>

<p>Implementations may define additional macros that begin with LC_. In addition to the macros, the <i>locale.h</i> header file also defines a structure type named <i>lconv</i>. The elements of this structure are described in Section A.8.2.</p>

<h2>The setiocale() Function</h2>

<pre>
#include <locale.h>
char *setlocale( int category, const char *locale);
</pre>

<p>The <code>setlocale()</code> function sets or queries locale-specific behavior for the part of the C language specified by category. category should be one of the macros defined in locale.h.</p>

<p>If locale is a null pointer, the function is interpreted as a query. It returns a string that represents the current locale setting for the specified
category. The only ANSI-defined locale is “C,” which represents the minimal environment for C translation. Implementations are free to define other locale strings.</p>

<p>You can find out what the implementation-defined locale is by entering a null string as the second parameter. In this case, setlocale() returns a
pointer to the string associated with the specified category. The program's current locale is not changed.</p>

<p>If <i>locale</i> is not a null pointer, the function is interpreted as a request to change the locale setting for the specified category. If the request can be honored, setlocale() returns the locale argument. If the request cannot be honored, <code>setlocale()</code> returns a null pointer. At program start-up, the equivalent of</p>

<pre>setlocale( LC_ALL, "C" );</pre>

<p>is executed.</p>
