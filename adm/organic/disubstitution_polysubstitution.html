<h1>Disubstitution and Polysubstitution</h1>

<p>In electrophilic aromatic substitution of a monosubstituted benzene, three products are possible: the new group may become oriented ortho, meta, or para to the existing group. Table 22.1 shows the orientation of nitration of a series of monosubstituted benzenes. Based on the information in Table 22.1 and other studies like it, we can make the following generalizations about the manner in which existing groups influence further substitution reactions.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p><i>Substituents affect the orientation of new groups</i>. Certain substituents (for example, -OCH<sub>3</sub> and -Cl) direct an incoming group preferentially to the ortho and para positions; other substituents (for example, -NO<sub>2</sub> and -COOH) direct it preferentially to the meta position. In other words, substituents on a benzene ring can be classified as <b>ortho-para directing</b> or as <b>meta directing</b>.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>Substituents affect the rate of further substitution</i>. Certain substituents cause the rate of a second substitution to be greater than that for benzene itself, whereas other substituents cause the rate of a second substitution to be lower than that for benzene. In other words, groups on a benzene ring can be classified as activating or <b>deactivating</b> toward further <b>substitution</b>.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>These directing and activating-deactivating effects can be seen by comparing the products and rates of nitration of anisole and nitration of benzoic acid. Nitration of anisole proceeds at a rate considerably greater than that for benzene (the methoxy group is activating), and the product is a mixture of <i>o</i>-nitroanisole and <i>p</i>-nitroanisole (the methoxy group is ortho-para directing).</p>

<p>Quite another situation is seen in the nitration of benzoic acid. First, the reaction requires the more reactive fuming nitric acid and a higher temperature than for benzene. Because nitration of benzoic acid proceeds much more slowly than nitration of benzene itself, we say that a carboxyl group is strongly deactivating.</p>

<p>Second, the product formed consists of approximately 80% of the meta isomer and 20% of the ortho and para isomers combined; thus we say that the carboxyl group is meta directing.</p>

<p>Listed in Table 2 are the directing and activating-deactivating effects for the major functional groups with which we are concerned in this text. If we compare these ortho-para and meta directors for structural similarities and differences, we can make the following generalizations.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Alkyl groups, phenyl groups, and substituents in which the atom bonded to the ring has an unshared pair of electrons are ortho-para directing. All other substituents are meta directing.</p></li>

	<li><p>Most ortho-para directing groups are activating. The exception to this generalization is the halogens, which are weakly deactivating.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The fact that alkyl groups are weakly activating is why it is difficult to stop Friedel-Crafts alkylations at monoalkylation. When a first alkyl group is introduced onto an aromatic ring, the ring is activated toward further alkylation and, unless reaction conditions are very carefully controlled, a mixture of di-, tri-, and polyalkylation products is formed. Friedel-Crafts acylations, on the other hand, never go beyond monoacylation because an acyl group is deactivating toward further substitution. <br> We can illustrate the usefulness of these generalizations by considering the synthesis of two different disubstituted derivatives of benzene. Suppose we wish to prepare <i>m</i>-bromonitrobenzene from benzene. This conversion can be done in two steps: nitration and bromination. If the steps are carried out in just that order, the major product is indeed <i>m</i>-bromonitrobenzene. The nitro group is a meta director and, therefore, directs bromination to a meta position.</p>

<p>As another example of the importance of the order in electrophilic aromatic substitutions, consider the conversion of toluene to p -nitrobenzoic acid. The nitro group can be introduced with a nitrating mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids. The carboxyl group can be produced by oxidation of the methyl group of toluene (Section 21.5A). Nitration of toluene yields a product with the two substituents in the desired para relationship. Nitration of benzoic acid, on the other hand, yields a product with the substituents meta to each other.</p>

<p>Again, we see that the order in which the reactions are performed is critical. Note that, in this last example, we showed nitration of toluene producing only the para isomer. Because methyl is an ortho-para directing group, both the ortho and para isomers are formed (Table 2). In problems of this type in which you are asked to prepare the para isomer, assume that both ortho and para isomers are formed but that there are physical methods by which they can be separated and the desired isomer obtained.</p>

<h2>Theory of Directing Effects</h2>

<p>As we have just seen, a group on a benzene ring exerts a major effect on the pattern of further substitution. We can account for these patterns by starting with the general mechanism fi rst presented in Section 22.1 for electrophilic aromatic substitution and carrying it a step further to consider how groups already present on the ring affect the energetics of further substitution. In this regard, we need to consider both resonance and inductive effects and the relative importance of each.</p>

<h3>Nitration of Anisole</h3>

<p>The rate of electrophilic aromatic substitution is limited by the slowest step in the mechanism. For the nitration of anisole, and for almost every other substitution we consider, the slow and rate-determining step is attack of the electrophile by the aromatic ring. The rate of this step depends on the stability of the transition state for this step. The more stable the transition state, the faster the rate-determining step and, thus, the overall reaction. Shown in Figure 22.2 is the cation intermediate formed by addition of the nitronium ion meta to the methoxy group. Also shown in the fi gure is the cation intermediate formed by addition para to the methoxy group. Note that, in terms of electronic effects, structural formulas for the cation formed by attack ortho to the methoxy group are essentially the same as those for para attack, so, for convenience, we deal only with para attack. The cation intermediate formed by meta attack is a hybrid of contributing structures (a), (b), and (c). The cation intermediate formed by para attack is a hybrid of contributing structures (d), (e), (f),
and (g). For each orientation, we can draw three contributing structures that place the positive charge on carbon atoms of the benzene ring. These three structures are the only ones that can be drawn for meta attack. However, for para attack (and for ortho attack as well), a fourth contributing structure, (f), can be drawn that involves an unshared pair of electrons on the oxygen atom of the methoxy group and places a positive charge on this oxygen. Structure (f) contributes more than structures (d), (e), or (g) because, in it, all atoms have complete octets. Because the cation formed by ortho or para attack on anisole has a greater degree of charge delocalization, and therefore a lower activation energy for its formation, nitration
of anisole occurs faster in the ortho and para positions.</p>

<h3>Nitration of Benzoic Acid</h3>

<p>Shown in Figure 22.3 are resonance-stabilized cation intermediates formed by attack of the nitronium ion meta to the carboxyl group and then para to it. Each cation in Figure 22.3 is a hybrid of three contributing structures; no additional ones can be drawn. Now we need to compare the relative resonance stabilization of each hybrid. If we draw a Lewis structure for the carboxyl group showing the partial positive charge on the carboxyl carbon, we see that contributing structure (e) in Figure 22.3 places positive charges on adjacent atoms.</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/Benzoic_acid_nitration.png" alt="Benzoic acid nitration"/>
<figcaption>Nitration of benzoic acid. Electrophilic attack meta and para to the carboxyl group.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Because of the electrostatic repulsion thus generated, this structure is very unstable and makes only a negligible contribution to the hybrid. None of the contributing structures for meta attack places positive charges on adjacent atoms. As a consequence, resonance stabilization of the cation for meta attack is greater than that for para (or ortho) attack. Stated alternatively, the activation energy for meta attack is less than that for para attack. Comparison of the entries in Table 22.1 shows that almost all the ortho-para directing groups have an unshared pair of electrons on the atom bonded to the aromatic ring. Thus, the directing effect of these groups is primarily attributable to a resonance effect, due to the ability of the atom bonded to the ring to further delocalize the positive charge of the cation intermediate formed when electrophilic attack occurs at the ortho or para positions. Recall that, all things being equal, delocalization of a charge stabilizes a charged species. <br>To account for the fact that alkyl groups are also ortho-para directing, we need to consider their inductive effect on stability of the cation intermediate. In the case of alkyl groups, there is an inductive polarization of electrons from the alkyl substituent toward the cationic ring of the intermediate. This polarization amounts to a further delocalization of the positive charge, thereby stabilizing the cationic intermediate. The alkyl groups are activating because, compared to benzene alone, the cationic intermediates are lower in energy with alkyl substituents at ortho or para positions. Recall that we used the electron-releasing inductive effect (that is, hyper-conjugation) of alkyl groups in Section 6.3A to account for the relative stabilities ofmethyl, primary, secondary, and tertiary carbocations as well. <br>The inductive polarization of electrons from alkyl groups (called hyperconjugation) is most effective at delocalizing the positive charge of the cation intermediate when the alkyl group is bonded directly to the ring atom carrying signifi cant positive charge. In other words, when the alkyl group is ortho or para to the location of the incoming electrophile.</p>

<img src="img/hyperconjugation_alkyl_groups.png" alt="hyperconjugation alkyl groups"/>

<h2>Theory of Activating-Deactivating Effects</h2>

<p>We account for the activating-deactivating effects of substituent groups by much the same combination of resonance and inductive effects.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Any resonance effect, such as that of —NH<sub>2</sub>, —OH, and —OR, that delocalizes the positive charge of the cation intermediate lowers the activation energy for its formation and has an activating effect toward further electrophilic aromatic substitution.</p></li>

	<li><p>Any resonance or inductive effect, such as that of —NO<sub>2</sub>, —C≡N, — C=O, —SO<sub>2</sub>—, and —SO<sub>3</sub>H, that decreases electron density on the ring deactivates the ring to further substitution.</p></li>

	<li><p>Any inductive effect, such as that of —CH<sub>3</sub> or another alkyl group, that releases electron density toward the cationic intermediate activates the ring toward further substitution.</p></li>

	<li><p>Any inductive effect, such as that of a halogen, —NR<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>, —CCl<sub>3</sub>, and —CF<sub>3</sub>, that decreases electron density on the ring deactivates the ring to further substitution.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>The halogens represent an interesting combination of the resonance and inductive effects, the two operating in opposite directions. Recall from Table 2 that halogens are ortho-para directing but, unlike other ortho-para directors listed in the table, they are weakly deactivating. These observations can be accounted for in the following way.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>The inductive effect of halogens: the halogens are relatively electronegative and have an electron-withdrawing inductive effect. Aryl halides, therefore, react more slowly in electrophilic aromatic substitution than benzene.</p></li>

	<li><p>The resonance effect of halogens: when a halogen-substituted aromatic ring is attacked by an electrophile to form a cation intermediate, a halogen ortho or para to the site of electrophilic attack can help to stabilize the cation intermediate by delocalization of the positive charge through resonance involving unshared electron pairs.</p></li>
</ol>

<img src="img/halonges_ortho-para.png" alt="halonges ortho para"/>

<p>Thus, the inductive and resonance effects of the halogens are counter to each other, but the former is somewhat stronger than the latter. The net effect of this opposition is that the halogens are weakly deactivating but ortho-para directing. <br>For cases involving electrophilic aromatic substitution of aromatic rings with two or more substituents already on the ring, the more activating group will dominate the orientation preference of the incoming group. This is because activating groups will activate the ring for more substitution according to their orientation preference, while deactivating groups only serve to deactivate the ring toward further substitution. In practice, this means that ortho-para directing groups will dominate meta directing groups when they are both on a ring.</p>
