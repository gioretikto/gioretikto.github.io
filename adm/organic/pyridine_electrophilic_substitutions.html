<h1>Pyridine Electrophilic substitutions</h1>

<p>Pyridine is an aromatic compound, but the replacement of CH by more electronegative N induces a dipole moment of 2.2 D denoting a shift of electron density from the ring towards the nitrogen atom (benzene which is symmetrical, has not dipole moment). The resonance description indicates that nitrogen atom of pyridine carries a partial negative charge and the carbon 2 and 4 bear partial positive charges</p>

<p>Pyridine is less reactive that benzene towards electrophilic substitution because:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Higher electronegativity of N lowers the electron density around C atoms;</p></li>
	<li><p>Electrophilic can coordinate with N to form resonance stabilized pyridinium salts: the N atom of pyridine carries a lone pair of electron which are NOT part of the &pi; system. As a result pyridine is a <i>base</i> (pK<sub>a</sub> 5.2), reacting with acids, Lewis acids and eletrophiles E<sup>+</sup> to form stable pyridinium salts, in which the hetero-cycle retains aromatic character</p>

</li>
</ol>

<p>From the resonance description you might think that although the primary site for electrophilic attack is at N-1, reactions at C-3(5) might be possible, even if not as likely. Direct attact at a ring carbon- even C-3 is normally slow because</p>

<ol type="a">
	<li><p>the concentration of free pyridine in equilibrium with the pyridinium salt is extremely low;</p></li>
	<li><p>attack upone the salt would also require the positive pyridinium cation to bond to a positively charged reactant.</p></li>
</ol>
