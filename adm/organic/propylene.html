<h1>CHEMICALS FROM PROPYLENE</h1>

<p>Propylene is an unsaturated organic hydrocarbon (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>CH=CH<sub>2</sub>) that has one double bond, and is a colorless gas (Table 1). It is a byproduct of crude oil refining and natural gas processing. <br> During oil refining, propylene (CH<sub>3</sub>CH=CH<sub>2</sub>,, like ethylene CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub>) is produced as a result of the thermal decomposition (cracking) of higher molecular weight hydrocarbon derivatives. A major source of propylene is naphtha cracking intended to produce ethylene, but it also results from refinery cracking producing other products. Propylene can be separated by fractional distillation from hydrocarbon mixtures obtained from cracking and other refining processes; refinery grade propylene is about 50%-70%. <br> 
Propane dehydrogenation converts propane (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>) into propylene (CH<sub>3</sub>CH=CH<sub>2</sub>) and byproduct hydrogen:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub></i>CH<sub>3</sub> ⟶ CH<sub>3</sub>—CH=CH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub></p>
</div>

<p>The propylene from propane yield is in the order of 85 mol%. Reaction byproducts (mainly hydrogen) are usually used as fuel for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. As a result, propylene tends to be the only product, unless local demand exists for hydrogen. In fact, a large proportion of the propylene is made from propane, which is obtained from natural gas stripper plants or from refinery gases.<br> 
Like ethylene, propylene is a reactive alkene that can be obtained from refinery gas streams, especially those from cracking processes. The main source of propylene, however, is steam cracking of hydrocarbon derivatives, where it is coproduced with ethylene. There is no special process for propylene production except the dehydrogenation of propane.</p>

<p>Increasing the yield of the valuable low molecular weight olefin derivatives, especially propylene and the butylene derivatives, remains a major challenge for many integrated refineries. As global
petrochemical demand for propylene continues to grow, opportunities for improved production routes will emerge. <br> Propylene has been considered as a byproduct of ethylene production via the steam cracking
of naphtha or other feedstocks. However, this route has not always able to keep up with propylene demand. To make up this shortfall, refineries may isolate propylene from the gaseous effluents of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units and purify it to either chemical grade or polymer grade propylene. While many refineries are, of necessity accepting heavy crude oil as the refinery feedstock, the
fluid catalytic cracking product slate is increasingly shifting toward the production of low-boiling olefin derivatives (mainly propylene). More stringent specifications for gasoline are needed in the
future, for which the current fluid catalytic cracking product slate is not optimal, because of high aromatics and olefin derivatives content.</p>
