<h1>Molecular Structure and Acidity</h1>

<p>Now let us examine in some detail the relationships between molecular structure and acidity. The overriding principle in determining the relative acidities of uncharged organic acids is the stability of the conjugate base anion, A<sup>-</sup> , resulting from loss of a proton; the more stable the anion, the greater the acidity of the acid, HA. As we discuss in this section, ways to stabilize A<sup>-</sup> include</p>

	<li><p>Having the negative charge on a more electronegative atom</p></li>
	<li><p>Having the negative charge on a larger atom</p></li>
	<li><p>Delocalizing the negative charge as described by resonance contributing structures</p></li>
	<li><p>Spreading the negative charge onto electron-withdrawing groups by the inductive effect (polarization of sigma bonds)</p></li>
	<li><p>Having the negative charge in an orbital with more s character</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>A. Electronegativity of the Atom Bearing the Negative Charge</h2>

<p>Let us consider the relative acidities of the following series of hydrogen acids, all of which are in the same period of the Periodic Table.</p>

<p>The pK<sub>a</sub> value for ethane is given in Table 4.1, but values for methylamine and methanol are not. We can, however, make good guesses about the pK<sub>a</sub> values of these acids by reasoning that the nature of the alkyl group bonded to nitrogen or oxygen has only a relatively small effect on the acidity of the hydrogen bonded to the heteroatom (in organic chemistry, an atom other than carbon). Therefore, we estimate that the pK<sub>a</sub> of methylamine is approximately the same as that of ammonia (pK<sub>a</sub> 38), and that the pK<sub>a</sub> of methanol is approximately the same as that of ethanol (pK<sub>a</sub> 15.9). As we see, ethane is the weakest acid in this series, and ethyl anion is the strongest conjugate base. Conversely, methanol is the strongest acid, and methoxide ion is the weakest conjugate base. The relative acidity within a period of the Periodic Table is related to the electronegativity of the atom in the anion that bears the negative charge. The greater the electronegativity of this atom, the more strongly its electrons are held, and the more stable the anion is. Conversely, the smaller the electronegativity of this atom, the less tightly its electrons are held, and the less stable the anion is. Oxygen, the most electronegative of the three atoms compared, has the largest electronegativity (3.5 on the Pauling scale), and methanol forms the most stable anion. Carbon, the least electronegative of the three (2.5 on the Pauling scale), forms the least stable anion. Because methanol forms the most stable anion, it is the strongest acid in this series. Ethane is the weakest acid in the series. It is essential to understand that this argument based on electronegativity applies only to acids within the same period (row) of the Periodic Table. Anions of atoms within the same period have approximately the same size, and their energies of solvation are approximately the same.</p>

<h2>B. Size of the Atom Bearing the Negative Charge</h2>

<p>To illustrate how the acidity of hydrogen acids varies within a group (column) of the Periodic Table, let us compare the acidities of methanol and methanethiol, CH<sub>3</sub>SH. We estimated in the previous section that the pK a of methanol is around 16, which is pretty close to its measure pK a value of 15.5. We can estimate the pK<sub>a</sub> of methanethiol in the following way. The pK<sub>a</sub> of hydrogen sulfi de, H<sub>2</sub>S, is given in Table 4.1 as 7.04. If we assume that substitution of a methyl group for a hydrogen makes only a slight change in acidity, we might estimate that the pK<sub>a</sub> of methanethiol is approximately 7.0. Actually, the pK<sub>a</sub> of methanethiol is around 10.4, the difference being a result of the different way in which the methanethiolate anion is solvated versus HS−−. Nevertheless, methanethiol is the stronger acid, and methanethiolate ion is the weaker conjugate base.</p>

<p>The relative acidity of these two hydrogen acids, and, in fact, any set of hydrogen acids within a group of the Periodic Table, is related to the size of the atom bearing the negative charge. Size increases from top to bottom within a group because the valence electrons are in increasingly higher principal energy levels. This means that (1) they are farther from the nucleus, and (2) they occupy a larger volume of space. Because sulfur is below oxygen in the Periodic Table, it is larger than oxygen. Accordingly, the negative charge on sulfur in methanethiolate ion is spread over a larger volume of space (more delocalized, Section 4.2B); therefore, the CH<sub>3</sub>S<sup>−</sup> anion is more stable. The negative charge on oxygen in methoxide ion is confined to a smaller volume of space; therefore, the CH<sub>3</sub>O<sup>−</sup> anion is less stable.</p>

<p>We see this same trend in the strength of the halogen acids, HF, HCl, HBr, and HI, which increase in strength from HF (the weakest) to HI (the strongest). Of their anions, iodide ion is the largest; its charge is delocalized over the largest volume of space and, therefore, is the most stable. HI is the strongest of the halogen acids. Conversely, fl uoride ion is the smallest anion; its charge is the most concentrated, and fl uoride ion is the least stable. HF is, therefore, the weakest acid of the halogen acids.
This size trend that we use to rationalize that HI is the strongest and HF the weakest acid of the halogen acids runs contrary to what would be predicted from electronegativity arguments. Based on electronegativity, fluoride has the most stable negative charge because fluorine is the most electro-negative element. Therefore, you would predict that HF should be the strongest acid. This is one example, of many in chemistry, where there are opposing trends that predict reactivity, and one of the trends dominates what we observe experimentally. We will return to the relative sizes of these ions in Chapter 9 at which point we will discuss the nature of their solvation in polar solvents. We will see that, for the ions of the same charge, the smaller the ion, the greater its solvation, and that the degree of solvation has a profound effect on their relative reactivities.</p>

<h2>C. Delocalization of Charge in the Anion</h2>

<p>Carboxylic acids are weak acids. Values of pK<sub>a</sub> for most unsubstituted carboxylic acids fall within the range 4 to 5. The pK<sub>a</sub> for acetic acid, for example, is 4.76. Values of pK<sub>a</sub> for most alcohols, compounds that also contain an 9OH group, fall within the range 15 to 18; the pK<sub>a</sub> for ethanol, for example, is 15.9. Thus, alcohols are slightly weaker acids than water (pK<sub>a</sub> = 15.7). We account for the greater acidity of carboxylic acids compared with alcohols using the resonance model and looking at the relative stabilities of the alkoxide and carboxylate ions. Our guideline is this: the more stable the conjugate base anion, the farther the position of equilibrium is shifted toward the right, and the more acidic the compound is.</p>

<p>In the alkoxide anion, the negative charge is localized on oxygen. In contrast, ionization of a carboxylic acid gives an anion for which we can write two equivalent contributing structures that result in delocalization of the negative charge of the conjugate base anion. Because of this delocalization of negative charge, a carboxylate anion is more stable than an alkoxide anion. Therefore a carboxylic acid is a stronger acid than an alcohol.</p>

<h2>D. Inductive Effect and Electrostatic Stabilization of the Anion</h2>

<p>We see an example of the <b>inductive effect</b> in alcohols in the fact that an electronegative substituent adjacent to the carbon bearing the −OH group increases the acidity of the alcohol. Compare, for example, the acidities of ethanol and 2,2,2-trifl uoroethanol. The acid dissociation constant for 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol is larger than that of ethanol by more than three orders of magnitude, which means that the 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxide ion is considerably more stable than the ethoxide ion.</p>

<p>We account for the increased stability of the 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxide ion in the following way. Fluorine is more electronegative than carbon (4.0 versus 2.5); therefore, the C−F bond has a signifi cant dipole, indicated in the following fi gure by symbols to show the partial charges. There is an attractive stabilization by the interaction of the negatively charged oxygen and the partial positive charge on the carbon bearing the fluorines, which results in stabilization of the trifl uoroethoxide ion. Another way to think about the relative acidity of these two compounds is to realize that some of the negative charge from the oxygen atom of the anion has been delocalized onto the electronegative fluorine atoms, thereby stabilizing the charged species through delocalization of the charge.</p>

<p>Stabilization by the inductive effect falls off rapidly with increasing distance of the electronegative atom(s) from the site of the negative charge. Compare, for example, the pK<sub>a</sub> values of alcohols substituted with fluorine on carbons 2 versus 3 versus 4. When fluorine atoms are more than two carbons away from the carbon bearing the −OH group, they have almost no effect on acidity.</p>

<p>We also see the operation of the inductive effect in the acidity of halogen-substituted carboxylic acids. The pK<sub>a</sub> values of these two acids indicate that chloroacetic acid is approximately two orders of magnitude more acidic than acetic acid. In the case of chloroacetate anion, the negative charge is stabilized by electrostatic interaction between the partial negative charges on the oxygens and the partial positive charge on the carbon bearing the chlorine atom.</p>

<p>As was the case with halogen substitution and the acidity of alcohols, the acid-enhancing effect of halogen substitution in carboxylic acids falls off rapidly with increasing distance between the point of substitution and the carboxyl group.</p>

<h2>E. Hybridization and the Percent <i>s</i> Character of the Atom Bearing the Negative Charge</h2>

<p>To see the effect of hybridization, we consider the case of two or more conjugate base anions, each with the same charge and same element bearing the charge. The only difference is the hybridization of the atom bearing the negative charge. The acidity of a hydrogen bound to a carbon atom of an alkane, an alkene, and an alkyne is of special importance to us. One of the major differences between the chemistry of alkynes and that of alkenes and alkanes is that a hydrogen bonded to a triply bonded carbon atom is
suffi ciently acidic that it can be removed by a strong base, such as sodium amide, NaNH<sub>2</sub> or sodium hydride, NaH. Table 4.3 gives pK<sub>a</sub> values for an alkyne, alkene, and alkane. Also given for comparison are values for ammonia and water. We account for the greater acidity of alkynes in the following way. The lone pair of electrons on a carbon anion lies in a hybrid orbital: an sp orbital for an alkyne anion, an <i>sp<sup>2</sup></i> orbital for an alkene anion, and an <i>sp<sup>3</sup></i> orbital for an alkane anion. An sp orbital has 50% s character; an <i>sp<sup>2</sup></i> orbital, 33%, and an <i>sp<sup>3</sup></i> orbital, 25% (Section 1.7). Electrons in an <i>s</i> orbital are lower in energy than those in a <i>p</i> orbital; that is, they are held more tightly to the nucleus. Therefore, the more s character in a hybrid orbital, the more electronegative the atom will be, and the more acidic a hydrogen bonded to it will be (and the more stable the anion will be). Of the three types of compounds, the carbon in an alkyne (sp hybridized with 50% <i>s</i> character) is the most electronegative. Therefore, an alkyne anion is the most stable of the series, and an alkyne is the strongest acid of the series. By similar reasoning, the alkane carbon (<i>sp<sup>3</sup></i> hybridized with 25% <i>s</i> character) is the least electronegative, and an alkane is the weakest acid of the series. An alkene anion, with 33% s character, is intermediate. </p>
