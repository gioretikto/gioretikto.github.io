<h1>Circular Dichroism (CD)</h1>

<p>Circular dichroism (CD) is an excellent tool for rapid determination of the secondary structure and folding properties of proteins that have been obtained using recombinant techniques or purified from tissues. The most widely used applications of protein CD are to determine whether an expressed, purified protein is folded, or if a mutation affects its conformation or stability. In addition, it can be used to study protein interactions. This protocol details the basic steps of obtaining and interpreting CD data and methods for analyzing spectra to estimate the secondary structural composition of proteins. CD has the advantage that it is that measurements may be made on multiple samples containing 20 µg or less of proteins in physiological buffers in a few hours. However, it does not give the residue-specific information that can be obtained by X-ray crystallography or NMR.</p>

<p>The rapid characterization of new proteins is of great importance for the fields of proteomics and structural genomics. Circular dichroism (CD) is an excellent method for rapidly evaluating the secondary structure, folding and binding properties of proteins. Briefly, circular dichroism is defined as the unequal absorption of left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light. A beam of light has time dependent electric and magnetic fields associated with it. If the light is polarized by passing through suitable prisms or filters its electric field, E, will oscillate sinusoidally in a single plane. When viewed from the front, the sinusoidal wave can be visualized as the resultant of two vectors of equal length, which trace out circles, one which rotates clockwise (E<sub>R</sub>) and the other which rotates counterclockwise (E<sub>L</sub>). The two circularly polarized waves have physical existence. The waves are 90 degrees out of phase with each other and can be separated using a variety of prisms or electronic devices which utilize Pockel's effect1. </p>

<p>Circularly polarized light can be produced from unpolarized (isotropic) light by first passing the beam through a polarizing filter (a linear polarizer, from which only one plea of linearity polarized or anisotropic light emerges) and then through a birifrengent plate. (e.g. a very thin quartz plate cut parallel to ist optical axis), which has two axes - one fast and one slow.</p>

<p>When asymmetric molecules interact with light, they may absorb right and left handed circularly polarized light to different extents (hence the term circular dichroism) and also have different indices of refraction for the two waves. The result is that the plane of the light wave is rotated and that the addition of the E<sub>R</sub> and E<sub>L</sub> vectors results in a vector that traces out an ellipse and the light is said to be elliptically polarized. CD is reported either in units of ΔE, the difference in absorbance of E<sub>R</sub> and E<sub>L</sub> by an asymmetric molecule, or in degrees ellipticity, which is defined as the angle whose tangent is the ratio of the minor to the major axis of the ellipse. [θ], the molar ellipticity in deg. · cm<sup>2</sup>/dmol = 3298ΔE.</p>

<p>CD is an excellent method of determining the secondary structure of proteins. When the chromophores of the amides of the polypeptide backbone of proteins are aligned in arrays, their optical transitions are shifted or split into multiple transitions due to “exciton” interactions (See Sreerama and Woody3 for a recent review). The result is that different structural elements have characteristic CD spectra (Figure 1a). For example, α-helical proteins have negative bands at 222 nm and 208 nm and a positive band at 193 nm4. Proteins with well-defined antiparallel β-pleated sheets (β-helices) have negative bands at 218 nm and positive bands at 195 nm5, while disordered proteins have very low ellipticity above 210 nm and negative bands near 195 nm6. The collagens are a unique class of proteins, which have three chains that wrap together in a triple helix. Each strand has a conformation resembling that of poly-L-proline7 in a extended helical conformation where all of the bonds are trans to each other (poly-L-proline II). Charged polypeptides, such as poly-L-glutamate or poly-L-lysine at neutral pH (originally thought to be in random coil conformation) have a similar extended poly-L-proline II-like conformation8–10. The spectra of some representative proteins, with widely varying conformations, are shown in Figure 1b. Because the spectra of proteins are so dependent on their conformation, CD can be used to estimate the structure of unknown proteins and monitor conformational changes due to temperature, mutations, heat, denaturants or binding interactions. While CD does not give the secondary structure of specific residues, as do X-ray crystallographic and NMR structural determinations, the method has the advantage that data can be collected and analyzed in a few hours on solutions of samples containing 20 µg or less of protein in aqueous buffers under physiological conditions. Secondary structure can also be estimated from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of proteins (FTIR)11–13 and Raman spectroscopy14 but in some cases the measurement must be made on protein films or in deuterium oxide.</p>

<p>In addition to the intrinsic circular dichroism of the protein backbone, when ligands with chromophores bind to proteins they may develop strong extrinsic CD bands that can also be used to follow binding. The aromatic chromophores of proteins, which have bands in the near ultraviolet region, are often in asymmetric environments and can be used to examine whether mutations change the tertiary structure of proteins.</p>

<p>Key considerations in designing and implementing CD experiments are discussed below.</p>
