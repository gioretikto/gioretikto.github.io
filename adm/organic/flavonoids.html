<h1>Flavonoids</h1>

<p>Numerous studies indicate that diets high in fruits and vegetables are associated with a healthy lifestyle. One reason for this is that fruits and vegetables contain compounds called <b>phytochemicals</b>. Phytochemicals are compounds found in plants that have biochemical activity in the human body even though they have no nutritional value. The functions that phytochemicals perform in the human body include antioxidant activity, cancer inhibition, cholesterol regulation, and anti-inflammatory activity.</p>

<p>Each fruit and vegetable is a unique package of phytochemicals, so consuming a wide variety of fruits and vegetables provides the body with the broadest spectrum of benefits. In such a situation, many phytochemicals are consumed in small amounts. This approach is much safer thantaking supplemental doses of particular phytochemicals: in larger doses, some phytochemicals are toxic.</p>

<p>A major group of phytochemicals are the flavonoids, of which more than 4000 individual compounds are known. All flavonoids are antioxidants, but some are stronger antioxidants than others, depending on their molecular structure. About 50 flavonoids are present in foods and in beverages derived from plants (tea leaves, grapes, oranges, and so on).</p>

<p>The core flavonoid structure presents both aromatic and cyclic ether ring systems. Of particular importance as antioxidants in foods are flavo noids known as flavones and flavonols, flavonoids whose core structures are enhanced by the presence of ketone and/or hydroxyl groups and a double bond in the oxygen-containing ring system. Their polyphenolic nature enables them to scavenge injurious radicald by hydrogen abstraction from phenol groups.</p>

<p>The formation of flavone and flavonol compounds normally depends on the action of light, so the highest concentration of these compounds generally occurs in leaves or in the skins of fruits, whereas only traces are found in parts of plants that grow below the ground. The common onion is, however, a well-known exception to this generalization. The most widespread flavonoid in food is the flavonol quercetin.</p>

<p>It is predominant in fruits, vegetables, and the leaves of various vegetables. In fruits, apples contain the highest amounts
of quercetin, the majority of it being found in the outer tissues (skin, peel). A small peeled apple contains about 5.7 mg of the antioxidant vitamin C. But the same amount of apple with the skin contains flavonoids and other phytochemicals that have the effect of 1500 mg of vitamin C. Onions are also major dietary sources of quercetin.</p>

<p>It is a powerful antioxidant, chelating mentals, scavenging radicald and preventing oxidation of low-density lipoproteins</p>

<p>In addition to their antioxidant benefits, flavonoids may also help fight bacterial infections. Recent studies indicate that flavonoids can stop the growth of some strains of drugresistant bacteria.</p>
