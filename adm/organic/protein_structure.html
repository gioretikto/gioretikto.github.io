<h1>Protein Structure</h1>

<p>Proteins are usually classified as either fibrous or globular, according to their three-dimensional shape. Fibrous proteins, such as the collagen in tendons and connective tissue and the myosin in muscle tissue, consist of polypeptide chains arranged side by side in long filaments. Because these proteins are tough and insoluble in water, they are used in nature for structural materials. Globular proteins, by contrast, are usually coiled into compact, roughly spherical shapes. These proteins are generally soluble in water and are mobile within cells. Most of the 3000 or so enzymes that have been characterized to
date are globular proteins. Proteins are so large that the word structure takes on a broader meaning than it does with simpler organic compounds. In fact, chemists speak of four different levels of structure when describing proteins.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>The <b>primary structure</b> of a protein is simply the amino acid sequence.</p></li>
	<li><p>The <b>secondary structure</b> of a protein describes how segments of the peptide backbone orient into a regular pattern.</p></li>
	<li><p>The <b>tertiary structure</b> describes how the entire protein molecule coils into an overall three-dimensional shape.</p></li>
	<li><p>The <b>quaternary structure</b> describes how different protein molecules come together to yield large aggregate structures.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Primary structure is determined, as we’ve seen, by sequencing the protein. Secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are determined either by NMR or by X-ray crystallography (Chapter 12 A Deeper Look).
The most common secondary structures are the a helix and the &beta;-pleated sheet. An <b>&alpha; helix</b> is a right-handed coil of the protein backbone, much like the coil of a spiral staircase (Figure 26.5a). Each turn of the helix contains 3.6 amino acid residues, with a distance between coils of 540 pm, or 5.4 Å. The structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between amide N− H groups and C=O groups four residues away, with an N− H····O distance of 2.8 Å. The a helix is an extremely common secondary structure, and almost all globular proteins contain many helical segments. Myoglobin, a small globular protein containing 153 amino acid residues in a single chain, is an example (Figure 26.5b).<br> A <b>&beta;-pleated sheet</b> differs from an a helix in that the peptide chain is fully extended rather than coiled and the hydrogen bonds occur between residues in adjacent chains (Figure 26.6a). The neighboring chains can run either in the same direction (parallel) or in opposite directions (antiparallel), although the antiparallel arrangement is more common and energetically somewhat more favorable. Concanavalin A, for instance, consists of two identical chains of 237 residues, with extensive regions of antiparallel &beta; sheets (Figure 26.6b).</p>

<h2>Tertiary Structure</h2>

<p><b>Tertiary (3°) structure refers</b> to the overall folding pattern and arrangement in space of all atoms in a single polypeptide chain. No sharp dividing line exists between secondary and tertiary structures. Secondary structure refers to the spatial arrange- ment of amino acids close to one another on a polypeptide chain, whereas tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional arrangement of all atoms of a polypeptide chain. Among the most important factors in maintaining 3° structure are disulfi de bonds, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and salt linkages.<b> Disulfide bonds</b> play an important role in maintaining tertiary structure. Disulfi de bonds are formed between side chains of two cysteine units by oxidation of their thiol groups (−SH) to form a disulfi de bond. Treatment of a
disulfi de bond with a reducing agent regenerates the thiol groups.</p>

<p>Because the tertiary structure of a globular protein is delicately held together by weak intramolecular attractions, a modest change in temperature or pH is often enough to disrupt that structure and cause the protein to become denatured. Denaturation occurs under such mild conditions that the primary structure remains intact but the tertiary structure unfolds from a specific glob­ular shape to a randomly looped chain (Figure 26.7).</p>

<p>Denaturation is accompanied by changes in both physical and biological properties. Solubility is drastically decreased, as occurs when egg white is cooked and the albumins unfold and coagulate. Most enzymes also lose all catalytic activity when denatured, since a precisely defined tertiary structure is required for their action. Although most denaturation is irreversible, some cases are known where spontaneous renaturation of an unfolded protein to its stable tertiary structure occurs, accompanied by a full recovery of biological activity.</p>

<ol type="i">
	<li><p>Boiling an egg: Here, tertiary structure of protein is changed and forms a disornanized polypeptide chain.</p></li>
	<li><p>Frying eggs: It causes denaturation of albumin. The egg white (albumin) is a liquid, which on heating gets converted to a solid.</p></li>
	<li><p>Sunburn: It is basically the denaturation of skin proteins occuring due to the reaction of skin proteins with UV radiations.</p></li>
	<li><p>Poisoning due to heavy metals ions like Hg<sup>2+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup> and Ag<sup>+</su>: It causes the denaturation of a certain enzyme by coordinating with carboxylate groups and sulfur atoms (in sulfide linkage).</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Quaternary Structure</h2>

<p>Most proteins of molecular weight greater than 50,000 consist of two or more noncovalently linked polypeptide chains. The arrangement of protein monomers into an aggregation is known as quaternary (4°) structure. A good example is hemoglobin, a protein that consists of four separate polypeptide chains: two &alpha;-chains of 141 amino acids each and two &beta;-chains of 146 amino acids each. The quaternary structure of hemoglobin is shown in Figure 27.19. <br>A major factor stabilizing the aggregation of protein subunits is the <b>hydrophobic effect</b>. When separate polypeptide chains fold into compact three-dimensional shapes to expose polar side chains to the aqueous environment and shield nonpolar side chains from water, hydrophobic “patches” still appear on the surface, in contact with water. These patches can be shielded from water if two or more monomers as- semble so that their hydrophobic patches are in contact. The numbers of subunits of several proteins of known quaternary structure are shown in Table 27.4. Other important factors include correctly located complementary hydrogen bonding and charged sites on different subunits. The formation of aggregates of well-defined structure based on specifi c structural units on the subunits is being explored in the new fi eld of molecular recognition, also referred to as supramolecular chemistry.</p>
