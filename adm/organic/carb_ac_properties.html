<h1>Carboxylic acids</h1>

<h2>Physical Properties</h2>

<p>In the liquid and solid states, carboxylic acids are associated by hydrogen bonding into dimers, as shown here for acetic acid in the liquid state.</p>

<img src="img/carboxylic_dimers.png" alt="hydrogen bonding into dimers, carboxylic acids"/>

<p>Carboxylic acids have significantly higher boiling points than other types of organic compounds of comparable molecular weight, such as alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones. For example, butanoic acid (Table 17.2) has a higher boiling point than either 1-pentanol or pentanal. The higher boiling points of carboxylic acids result from their polarity and from the fact that they form very strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Carboxylic acids also interact with water molecules by hydrogen bonding through both the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. Because of greater hydrogen-bonding interactions, carboxylic acids are more soluble in water than alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, and ketones of comparable molecular weight. The solubility of a carboxylic acid in water decreases as its molecular weight increases. We account for this trend in the following way. A carboxylic acid consists of two regions of distinctly different polarity: a polar <b>hydrophilic</b> carboxyl group and, except for formic acid, a nonpolar <b>hydrophobic</b> hydrocarbon chain. The hydrophilic carboxyl group increases water solubility; the hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain decreases water solubility.</p>

<p>The first four aliphatic carboxylic acids (formic, acetic, propanoic, and butanoic acids) are infinitely soluble in water because the hydrophobic character of the hydro carbon chain is more than counterbalanced by the hydrophilic character of the carboxyl group. As the size of the hydrocarbon chain increases relative to the size of the hydrophilic group, water solubility decreases. The solubility of hexanoic acid is 1.0 g/100 g H<sub>2</sub>O, while that of decanoic acid is only 0.2 g/100 g H<sub>2</sub>O. One other physical property of carboxylic acids must be mentioned. The liquid carboxylic acids from propanoic acid to decanoic acid have extremely foul odors, about as bad as those of thiols, though different. Butanoic acid is found in stale perspiration, is a major component of “locker room odor,” and provides the characteristic odor of regurgitated milk. Pentanoic acid smells even worse, and goats, which secrete C<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>8</sub>, and C<sub>10</sub> acids, are famous for their unpleasant odors.</p>

<h2>Acidity</h2>

<p>Carboxylic acids are weak acids. Values of <i>K<sub>a</sub></i> for most unsubstituted aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids fall within the range 10<sup>-4</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup>. The value of <i>K<sub>a</sub></i> for acetic acid, for example, is 1.74 x 10<sup>-5</sup>. Its pK<sub>a</sub> is 4.76.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>CH<sub>3</sub>COOH + H<sub>2</sub>O ⥄ CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>−</sup> + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> &emsp; K<sub>a</sub> = [CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>−</sup>] [H<sub>2</sub>O] / [CH<sub>3</sub>COOH ] = 1.74 x 10<sup>-5</sup>; &emsp;  pK<sub>a</sub> = 4.76</p>
</div>

<p>We saw studying <a href="structure_acidity.html">the relationships between molecular structure and acidity</a>, the greater acidity of carboxylic acids (pK<sub>a</sub> 4–5) compared with alcohols (pK<sub>a</sub> 16–18) is because of delocalization of the negative charge of the carboxylate anion through resonance, and because of the electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the carbonyl group. There is no comparable resonance or inductive stabilization of alkoxide ions.</p>

<figcaption>Equivalent contributing structures; the carboxylate anion is stabilized by delocalization of the negative charge</fgicaption>
</figure>

<p>Substitution at the &alpha;-carbon of an atom or group of atoms of higher electronegativity than carbon further increases the acidity of carboxylic acids by the inductive effect. Compare, for example, the acidity of acetic acid (pK<sub>a</sub> 4.76) and chloroacetic acid (pK<sub>a</sub> 2.86). To see the effects of multiple halogen substitution, compare the values of pK<sub>a</sub> for acetic acid with its mono-, di-, and trichloro derivatives. A single chlorine substituent increases acid strength by nearly 100. Trichloroacetic acid, the strongest of the three acids, is a stronger acid than H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p>The trend found in the above chart for the acidity of the substituted carboxylic acids is best understood by an analysis of the stability of the anionic conjugate bases that are created. The electron withdrawing ability of the electronegative chlorine atoms stabilizes the nearby anionic charge by electron withdrawal through &sigma;-bonds. The strength of this inductive effect is proportional to the number of chlorine atoms present, explaining why trichloroacetic acid is the strongest acid in the series.</p>

<img src="img/trichloroacetic_acid.png" alt="trichloroacetic acid"/>
<figcaption>Inductive effect spreads the negative charge onto the chlorine atoms.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We also see an example of the inductive effect in a comparison of the relative acidities of benzoic acid and acetic acid. Because of the stronger electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon of the benzene ring compared with the sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized carbon of the methyl group, benzoic acid is a stronger acid than acetic acid; its <i>K<sub>a</sub></i> is approximately four times that of acetic acid.</p>

<p>One final point about carboxylic acids: when a carboxylic acid dissolves in an aqueous solution, the form of the carboxylic acid present depends on the pH of the solution in which it is dissolved. Consider typical carboxylic acids, which have pK a values in the range of 4.0 to 5.0. When the pH of the solution is equal to the pK a of the carboxylic acid (that is, the pH of the solution is in the range 4.0 to 5.0), the acid and its anion (its conjugate base) are present in equal concentrations. If the pH of the solution is adjusted to 2.0 or lower by the addition of a strong acid, the carboxylic acid then is present in solution almost entirely as RCOOH. If, on the other hand, the pH of the solution is adjusted to 7.0 or higher, the carboxylic acid is present almost entirely as its anion. Thus, even in a neutral solution (pH 7.0), a carboxylic acid is present predominantly as its anion.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>CH<sub>3</sub>COOH (predominant at pH &lt; 2.0) ⇌ CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>−</sup> +  CH<sub>3</sub>COOH (equal amount at pH = pK<sub>a</sub>)  ⇌ CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>−</sup> (predominant at pH &lt; 7.0)</p>
</div>

<p>A carboxylate anion has a negative charge, so in biological systems, molecules with substantial numbers of carboxylate anions have considerable negative charge. Because of the hydrophilic character of carboxylate anions, molecules with a large number of them are highly water-soluble.</p>

<h2>Reaction with Bases</h2>

<p>All carboxylic acids, whether soluble or insoluble in water, react with NaOH, KOH, and other strong bases to form water-soluble salts.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Ar-COOH (benzoic acid: slightly soluble in water) + NaOH ⟶ Ar-COO<sup>&minus;</sup> Na<sup>+</sup> (Sodium benzoate 60g/100 mL water) + H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
</div>

<p>Carboxylic acids also form water-soluble salts with ammonia and amines:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Ar-COOH (benzoic acid: slightly soluble in water) + NH<sub>3</sub> ⟶ Ar-COO<sup>&minus;</sup> NH<sub>4</sub> (Ammonium benzoate 20g/100 mL water) + H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
</div>

<p>Carboxylic acids react with sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate to form water-soluble sodium salts and carbonic acid (a weaker acid). Carbonic acid, in turn, decomposes to give water and carbon dioxide, which evolves as a gas.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>CH<sub>3</sub> COOH + NaHCO<sub>3</sub> ⟶  CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sub>2</sub>Na<sup>+</sup> + CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
</div>

<p>Salts of carboxylic acids are named in the same manner as the salts of inorganic acids; the cation is named before the anion. The name of the anion is derived from the name of the carboxylic acid by dropping the suffix -<i>ic</i> acid and adding the suffix -<i>ate</i>.</p>

<p>A consequence of the water solubility of carboxylic acid salts is that water-insoluble carboxylic acids can be converted to water-soluble ammonium or alkali metal salts and extracted into aqueous solution. The salt, in turn, can be transformed back to the free carboxylic acid by addition of HCl, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, or other strong acid. These reactions allow an easy separation of carboxylic acids from water-insoluble non-acidic compounds.</p>
