<h1>The E2 reaction</h1>

<p>The <b>E2 reaction</b> (for <i>elimination, bimolecular</i>) occurs when an alkyl halide is treated with a strong base, such as hydroxide ion or alkoxide ion (RO<sup>−</sup>). It is the most commonly occurring pathway for elimination and can be formulated as shown in Figure 1.</p>

<figure>

<figcaption><b>Fig.1</b>. (<b>Step 1</b>). Base (B ) attacks a neighboring hydrogen and begins to remove the H at the same time as the alkene double bond starts to form and the X group starts to leave. (<b>Step 2</b>). Neutral alkene is produced when the C–H bond is fully broken and the X group has departed with the C–X bond electron pair.</figcpation>

<p>Like the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, the E2 reaction takes place in one step without intermediates. As the base begins to abstract H<sup>+</sup> from a carbon next to the leaving group, the C−H bond begins to break, a C=C bond begins to form, and the leav­ ing group begins to depart, taking with it the electron pair from the C − X bond. Among the pieces of evidence supporting this mechanism is that E2 reactions show second-order kinetics and follow the rate law: rate = <i>k</i> x [RX] x [Base]. That is, both base and alkyl halide take part in the rate-limiting step.<br> A second piece of evidence in support of the E2 mechanism is provided by a phenomenon known as the <b>deuterium isotope effect</b>. For reasons that we won’t go into, a carbon–hydrogen bond is weaker by about 5 kJ/mol (1.2 kcal/mol) than the corresponding carbon–deuterium bond. Thus, a C−H bond is more easily broken than an equivalent C − D bond, and the rate of C −H bond cleavage is faster. For instance, the base-induced elimination of HBr from 1-bromo-2-phenylethane proceeds 7.11 times as fast as the corresponding elimination of DBr from 1-bromo-2,2-dideuterio-2-phenylethane. This result tells us that the C−H (or C−D) bond is broken in the rate-limiting step, consistent with our picture of the E2 reaction as a one-step process. If it were otherwise, we couldn’t measure a rate difference.</p>

<h2>Stereoselectivity</h2>

<p>Yet a third piece of mechanistic evidence involves the stereochemistry of E2 eliminations.  The stereochemistry of E2 reactions is controlled by a conformational effect. The ­lowest-energy transition state of an E2 reaction is commonly the one in which the −Lv and −H are oriented anti and coplanar (at a dihedral angle of 180°) to each other. The reason for this preferred geometry is that it allows for proper ­orbital ­overlap between the base, the proton being removed, and the departing leaving group. Remembering the anti and coplanar geometry requirement is important b ecause it allows prediction of alkene stereochemistry in E2 reactions, namely whether E or Z products are produced.</p>

<p>This is shown more clearly in a Newman projection with a bromide as the leaving group.</p>

<p>As with the required backside attack associated with an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, there is an orbital-based reason for the anti and coplanar arrangement of the —H and −Lv involved in an E2 reaction. The following diagram shows a filled C−H s bonding molecular orbital aligned with the empty C−Lv s antibonding molecular orbital.</p>

<img src="img/E2_orbitals.png" alt="E2 orbitals"/>

<p>As the strong base removes the proton, we consider the two electrons in the C−H orbital filling the antibonding C−Lv orbital and thereby breaking the C−Lv bond. An anti and coplanar arrangement of the C!H and C−Lv leads to proper phasing in the resulting &pi; bond. <br>For example, treatment of 1,2-dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane with sodium methoxide in methanol gives 1-bromo-1,2-diphenylethylene. The meso isomer of 1,2-dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane gives (E )-1-bromo-1,2-diphenylethylene, whereas the racemic mixture of 1,2-dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane gives (Z )-1-bromo-1,2-­diphenylethylene.</p>
