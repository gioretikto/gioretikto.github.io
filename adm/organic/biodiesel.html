<h1>Biodiesel</h1>

<p>Biodiesel, promoted as an alternative to petroleum-based fuels used in diesel engines, is made from plant and animal oils. Chemically, biodiesel is a mixture of esters of long-chain fatty acids prepared from plant and animal fats and oils by <a href="transesterification.html">trans-esterification</a>. This is a reaction between an ester (The major components of plantbased oils and animal fats are <a href="triacylglycerols.html">triacylglycerols</a>) and an alcohol in which the −OR′′ on the alcohol exchanges with the OR′ group of the ester (where R′ and R′′ are organic groups):</p>

<p>Thus Biodiesel fuel consists of the monoalkyl esters of plant oils or animal fats, which means that it is renewable because the CO<sub>2</sub> produced by its combustion comes from recently grown plants, and growing oilseed plants will uptake this CO<sub>2</sub> for photosysntethis and the production of more oil seeds.</p>

<p>The reaction of fats and oils with methanol (in the presence of a catalyst to speed up the reaction) produces a mixture of the methyl esters of the fatty acids and glycerol. Glycerol, a by-product of the reaction, is a valuable commodity for the health care industry, so it is separated and sold. The mixture of esters that remains can be used directly as a fuel in existing diesel engines, or it can be blended with petroleum products. In the latter case, the fuel mixture is identified by a designation such as B20 (B = biodiesel, 20 refers to 20% by volume). Biodiesel has the advantage of being clean burning with fewer environmental problems associated with exhaust gases. In particular, there are no SO<sub>2</sub> emissions, one of the common problems associated with petroleum-based diesel fuels.</p>
