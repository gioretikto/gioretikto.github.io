<h1>Ethers</h1>

<p>The functional group of an <b>ether</b> is an atom of oxygen bonded to two carbon atoms. Figure 1 shows a Lewis structure and a ball-and-stick model of dimethyl ether, CH<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>, the simplest ether. In dimethyl ether, two <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals of oxygen form &sigma; bonds to the two carbon atoms. The other two sp<sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals of oxygen each contain an unshared pair of electrons. The C−O−C bond angle in dimethyl ether is 110.3°, a value close to the tetrahedral angle of 109.5°.</p>

<p>In still other ethers, the ether oxygen is bonded to sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbons. In ethoxyethene (ethyl vinyl ether), for example, the ether oxygen is bonded to one sp<sup>3</sup> and one sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon.</p>

<h2>Physical properties</h2>

<p>Ethers are polar molecules in which oxygen bears a partial negative charge and each attached carbon bears a partial positive charge (Figure 2). However, only weak dipole-dipole interactions exist between ether molecules in the liquid state. Consequently, boiling points of ethers are much lower than those of alcohols of comparable molecular weight (Table 11.1) and are close to those of hydrocarbons
of comparable molecular weight (Table 2.5).</p>

<p>Because ethers cannot act as hydrogen bond donors, they are much less soluble in water than <a href="alcohols.html">alcohols</a>. However, they can act as hydrogen bond acceptors (Figure 3), which makes them more water-soluble than hydrocarbons of comparable molecular weight and shape (compare data in Tables 2.5 and 11.1).</p>

<h2>Ether Safety Alert: Flammability and Formation of Hydroperoxides</h2>

<p>Two hazards must be avoided when working with diethyl ether and other low-molecular-weight ethers. First, the commonly used ethers have low boiling points and are highly flammable, a dangerous combination. Consequently, open flames and electric appliances with sparking contacts must be avoided where ethers are being used (laboratory refrigerators and ovens are frequent causes of ignition). Because diethyl ether is so volatile (its boiling point is 35°C), it should be used in a fume hood to prevent the build-up of vapors and possible explosion. Second, anhydrous ethers react with molecular oxygen at a C—H bond adjacent to the ether oxygen to form <b>hydroperoxides</b>, which are dangerous because they are explosive.</p>

<table class="noborder">
<tr><td>CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> <br>Diethyl ether</td> <td>+</td> <td>O<sub>2</sub></td> <td>⟶</td> <td>CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub>2</sub>O—O—H<br>A hydroperoxide</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Hydroperoxidation proceeds by a radical chain mechanism (see “Chemical Connections: Antioxidants” in Chapter 8). Rates of hydroperoxide formation increase dramatically if the C9H bond adjacent to oxygen is secondary, as for example in diisopropyl ether, because of favored generation of a relatively stable 3° radical intermediate next to oxygen.</p>

<h2>Uses</h2>

<p>The discovery that inhaling ethers could make a patient insensitive to pain revolutionized the practice of medicine. Isoflurane, CF<sub>3</sub>CHClOCHF<sub>2</sub>, a halogenated ether widely used as an inhalation anesthetic in both human and veterinary medicine.</p>

<h3>Ethylene Oxide Sterilization Process</h3>

<p>Ethylene oxide, a cyclic ether, called oxirane by IUPAC, is an organic compound with the formula C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O.</p>

<p>In its pure form (100 percent), ethylene oxide vapor is flammable and explosive when allowed to mix with as little as a 3 percent air by volume2. To safely utilize the gas as an industrial sterilant, the process is designed using cycle phases which are delivered in such a manner that will never allow the process to enter into an unsafe condition. The process may be described in a very simple form as follows:
Using a vacuum-tight chamber, an initial vacuum is drawn to remove air and prevent an unsafe mixture when EO is injected. After the vacuum is complete, moisture, usually in the form of steam, is added to the chamber to replace that moisture which is lost during the initial vacuum phase.</p>

<p>Next in the sequence is the introduction of the ethylene oxide gas to a predetermined concentration. The concentration has been selected to assure an adequate sterilization process is delivered. Finally, after the product is allowed to soak in the EO for a controlled and predetermined amount of time, a series of washes is performed to rid the chamber of the EO. A wash consists of pulling a vacuum followed by a pressurization with an inert gas, which is usually nitrogen. The vacuum and pressurization processes are repeated for a predetermined number of repetitions until the chamber atmosphere is below the flammability limit of 3% for EO.</p>
