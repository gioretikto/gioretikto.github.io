<h1>Naming Chiral Centers − The <i>R,S</i> System</h1>

<p>So far, we have discussed the fact that enantiomers exist. We have not considered the question of which isomer is which, that is, the absolute confi guration, or which is the right-handed enantiomer and which is the left. For a given sample of a pure enantiomer, the correct arrangement must be determined by experiment. Experimental determination of absolute confi guration can be accomplished by using x-ray analysis of a derivative that has a chiral center with a known absolute confi guration. In biological molecules, many absolute confi gurations were determined by comparison to absolute configurations of the chiral center in glyceraldehyde.</p>

<p>A system for designating the absolute confi guration of a chiral center was devised in the late 1950s by R. S. Cahn and C. K. Ingold in England and V. Prelog in Switzerland and is named after them. The system, also called the R,S system, has been incorporated into the IUPAC rules of nomenclature. The orientation of groups about a chiral center is specifi ed using a set of priority rules.

<h5>Priority Rules</h5>

<ol>
	<li><p>Each atom bonded to the chiral center is assigned a priority. Priority is based on atomic number; the higher the atomic number, the higher the priority. Following are several substituents arranged in order of increasing priority. The atomic number of the atom determining priority is shown in parentheses.</p>
	
	<table class="noborder">
	<tr><th colspan="8">Increasing priority ⟶</th></tr>
	<tr><td>(1)</td> <td>(6)</td> <td>(7)</td> <td>(8)</td> <td>(16)</td> <td>(17)</td> <td>(35)</td> <td>(53)</td> </tr>
	<tr><td>−H,</td> <td>−CH<sub>3</sub>,</td> <td>−NH<sub>2</sub>,</td> <td>−OH,</td> <td>−SH,</td> <td>−Cl,</td> <td>−Br,</td> <td>−I</td></tr>
	</table>

</li>

<li><p>If priority cannot be assigned on the basis of the atoms bonded directly to the chiral center (because of a tie, that is, the same first atom on more than one substituent), look at the next set of atoms and continue until a priority can be assigned. Priority is assigned at the first point of difference. Following is a series of groups arranged in order of increasing priority. The atomic number of the atom on which the assignment of priority is based is shown above it.</p></li>

	<table class="noborder">
	<tr><th colspan="8">Increasing priority ⟶</th></tr>
	<tr><td>(1)</td> <td>(6)</td> <td>(7)</td> <td>(8)</td> <td>(17)</td>  </tr>
	<tr><td>−CH<sub>2</sub>−H,</td> <td>−CH<sub>2</sub>−CH<sub>3</sub>,</td> <td>−CH<sub>2</sub>−NH<sub>2</sub>,</td> <td>−CH<sub>2</sub>−OH,</td> <td>−CH<sub>2</sub>−Cl,</td> </tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>If two carbons have substituents of the same priority, priority is assigned to the carbon that has more of these substituents. Thus, −CHCl<sub>2</sub> &gt; −CH<sub>2</sub> Cl.</p></li>
	
	<li><p>Atoms participating in a double or triple bond are considered to be bonded to an equivalent number of similar “phantom” atoms (shown here highlighted) by single bonds; that is, atoms of the double bond are duplicated, and atoms of a triple bond are triplicated. The phantom atoms are bonded to no other atoms.</p>
	
	<p>−CH≡CH<sub>2</sub> is treated as −HCC − CCH<sub>2</sub></p>
	<p>−HC=0 is treatep as OC − HCO</p>
	<p>−CH≡CH is treated as −CCC − CCH</p>
	<p>−C≡N is treated as −NCN − CNC</p>
	</li>
	
	<li><p><i>Note</i>: priority assignment is made at the fi rst point of difference between groups. A common mistake is to assume that larger groups must always have higher priority, but this might not necessarily be the case. For example, a −CH<sub>2</sub>−Cl group has priority over a −CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> group because the Cl atom is the first point of difference.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>How to Assing R or S configuration to a Chiral Center</h2>

<ol>
	<li><p>Locate the chiral center, identify its four substituents, and assign a priority from 1 (highest) to 4 (lowest) to each substituent.</p></li>
	<li><p>Orient the molecule in space so that the group of lowest priority (4) is directed away from you, analogously to the steering column of a car. The three groups of higher priority (1–3) then project toward you, as would the spokes of the steering wheel.</p></li>
	<li><p>Read the three groups projecting toward you in order from highest priority (1) to lowest priority (3).</p></li>
	<li><p>If the groups are read in a clockwise direction, the confi guration is designated as R (Latin: rectus, straight, correct); if they are read in a counterclockwise direction, the confi guration is S (Latin: sinister, left). You can also visualize this as follows: turning the steering wheel to the right (down the order of priority) equals R; turning it to the left equals S.</p></li>
