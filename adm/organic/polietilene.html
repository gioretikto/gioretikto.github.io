<h1>Polietilene</h1>

<p>The ingredient or monomer is <b>ethylene</b> (IUPAC name <b>ethene</b>), a gaseous hydrocarbon with the formula C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, which can be viewed as a pair of <b>methylene groups</b> (–CH<sub>2</sub>–) connected to each other. Typical specifications are &lt;5 ppm for water, oxygen, and other alkenes. Acceptable contaminants include N<sub>2</sub>, ethane (common precursor to ethylene), and methane. Ethylene is usually produced from petrochemical sources, but also is generated by dehydration of ethanol.</p>

<h2>Polymerization</h2>

<p>Ethylene is a stable molecule that polymerizes only upon contact with catalysts. The conversion is highly exothermic. Coordination polymerization is the most pervasive technology, which means that metal chlorides or metal oxides are used. The most common catalysts consist of titanium(III) chloride, the so-called Ziegler–Natta catalysts. Another common catalyst is the Phillips catalyst, prepared by depositing chromium(VI) oxide on silica. Polyethylene can be produced through radical polymerization, but this route has only limited utility and typically requires high-pressure apparatus.</p>

<p>From the perspective of the chemical industry, the single most important reaction of alkenes is chain-growth polymerization, a type of polymerization in which monomer units are joined together without loss of atoms. An example is the formation of polyethylene from ethylene.</p>

<p>The mechanism of this type of polymerization differs greatly from the mechanism of step-growth polymerizations. In the latter, all monomers plus the polymer end-groups possess equally reactive functional groups, allowing for all possible combinations of reactions to occur, including monomer with monomer, dimer with dimer, and so forth. In contrast, chain-growth polymerizations involve endgroups possessing reactive intermediates that react with a monomer only. The reactive intermediates used in chain-growth polymerizations include radicals, carbanions, carbocations, and organometallic complexes.
The number of monomers that undergo chain-growth polymerizations is large and includes such compounds as alkenes, alkynes, allenes, isocyanates, and cyclic
compounds, such as lactones, lactams, ethers, and epoxides. We concentrate on the chain-growth polymerizations of ethylene and substituted ethylenes and show how these compounds can be polymerized by radical, cation, anion, and organometallic mediated mechanisms.</p>

<p>The first commercial process for ethylene polymerization used peroxide catalysts at temperatures of 500°C and pressures of 1000 atm and produced a
soft, tough polymer known as low-density polyethylene (LDPE). At the molecular level, chains of LDPE are highly branched owing to chain-transfer reactions.
Because this extensive chain branching prevents polyethylene chains from packing efficiently, LDPE is largely amorphous and transparent, with only a small amount of crystallites of a size too small to scatter light. LDPE has a density between 0.91 and 0.94 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and a melt transition temperature (<i>T<sub>m</sub></i>) of about 108°C. Because its <i>T<sub>m</sub></i> is only slightly above 100°C, it cannot be used for products that will be exposed to boiling water. Approximately 65% of all low-density polyethylene is used for the manufacture of films. Fabrication of LDPE films is done by a blow-molding technique illustrated in Figure 29.4. A tube of molten LDPE along with a jet of compressed air is forced through an opening and blown into a giant, thin-walled bubble. The film is then cooled and taken up onto a roller. This double-walled film can be slit down the side to give LDPE film or it can be sealed at points along its length to make LDPE bags. LDPE film is inexpensive, which makes it ideal for trash bags and for packaging for such consumer items as baked goods, vegetables, and other produce radicals are less likely to undergo hydrogen abstraction reactions. Polystyrene typically exhibits only one branch per 4000 to 10,000 monomer units.

<h2>Ziegler-Natta Chain-Growth Polymerizations</h2>

<p>An alternative method for polymerization of alkenes, which does not involve radicals, was developed by Karl Ziegler of Germany and Giulio Natta of Italy in the 1950s. For their pioneering work, they were awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in chemistry. The early Ziegler-Natta catalysts were highly active, heterogeneous catalysts composed of a MgCl<sub>2</sub> support, a Group 4B transition metal halide, such as TiCl<sub>4</sub>, and an alkylaluminum compound, such as Al(CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> Cl. These catalysts bring about polymerization of ethylene and propylene at 1 to 4 atm and at temperatures as low as 60°C. Polymerizations under these conditions do not involve radicals</p>

<p>The active catalyst in a Ziegler-Natta polymerization is thought to be an alkyltitanium compound, which is formed by alkylation of the titanium halide
by Al(CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl on the surface of a MgCl<sub>2</sub>/TiCl<sub>4</sub> particle. Once formed, this species repeatedly inserts ethylene into the titanium-carbon bond to yield polyethylene.</p>

<p>Over 2.5 3 10 11 kg of polyethylene are produced worldwide every year using optimized Ziegler-Natta catalysts, and large-scale reactors can yield up to 1.25 3 10 5 kg of polyethylene per hour. Production of polymer at this scale is partly attributable to the mild conditions required for a Ziegler-Natta polymerization and the fact that the polymer obtained has substantially different physical and mechanical properties from that obtained by radical polymerization. Polyethylene from Ziegler-Natta systems, termed high-density polyethylene (HDPE), has a higher density (0.96 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) and <i>T<sub>m</sub></i> (133°C) than low-density polyethylene, is three to ten times stronger, and is opaque rather than transparent. This added strength and opacity is the result of a much lower degree of chain branching and the resulting higher degree of crystallinity of HDPE compared with LDPE. Approximately 45% of all HDPE used in the United States is blow molded. In blow molding, a short length of HDPE tubing is placed in an open die [Figure 29.5(a)], and the die is closed, sealing the bottom of the tube. Compressed air is then forced into the hot polyethylene/die assembly, and the tubing is literally blown up to take the shape of the mold [Figure 29.5(b)]. After cooling, the die is opened [Figure 29.5(c)], and there is the container! Even greater improvements in properties of HDPE can be realized through special processing techniques. In the melt state, HDPE chains adopt random coiled conformations similar to those of cooked spaghetti. Engineers have developed special extrusion techniques that force the individual polymer chains of HDPE to uncoil and adopt an extended linear conformation. These extended chains then align with one another to form highly crystalline materials. HDPE processed in this fashion is stiffer than steel and has approximately four times the tensile strength of steel! Because the density of polyethylene (&lt;1.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) is considerably less than that of steel (8.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), these comparisons of strength and stiffness are even more favorable if they are made on a weight basis. In recent years, there have been several important advances made in catalysts used in Ziegler-Natta-type polymerizations. One of the most important has been the discovery of soluble complexes that catalyze the polymerization of ethylene and propylene at extraordinary rates. Because these new homogeneous catalysts are substantially different in structure from the early Ziegler-Natta systems, these polymerizations are referred to as coordination polymerizations. Catalysts for coordination polymerizations are frequently formed by allowing bis-(cyclopentadienyl) dimethylzirconium, [Cp<sub>2</sub> Zr(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>], to react with methaluminoxane (MAO). MAO is a complex mixture of methylaluminum oxide oligomers, [-(CH<sub>3</sub>)AlO-)<sub>n</sub>], formed by allowing trimethylaluminum to react with small amounts of water. It is thought that MAO activates the zirconium by abstracting a methyl anion to form a zirconium cation that is the active polymerization catalyst.</p>
