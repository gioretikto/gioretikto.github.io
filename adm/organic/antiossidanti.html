<h1>Antiossidanti</h1>

<p>Gli antiossidanti naturali agiscono tramite diversi meccanismi, possono agire:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>da riducenti</p></li>
	<li><p>da terminatori delle reazioni a catena radicaliche</p></li>
	<li><p>da inibitori della formazione di ossigeno singoletto</p></li>
	<li><p>da inattivatori dei metalli pro-ossidanti</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I più comuni antiossidanti sono:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>costituiti o derivati di flavoni</p></li>
	<li><p>isoflavoni</p></li>
	<li><p>catechine</p></li>
	<li><p>eugenolo</p></li>
	<li><p>cumarine</p></li>
	<li><p>tocoferoli</p></li>
	<li><p>acido cinnamico</p></li>
	<li><p>tannini</p></li>
	<li><p>carotenoidi</p></li>
	<li><p>fosfatidi</p></li>
	<li><p>acidi organici polifunzionali</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I flavonoidi hanno un'elevata capacità di donare un atomo di H ai radicali perossilici, terminando le reaioni a catena.</p>

<h2>Vitamina C</h2>

<p>Also known as ascorbic acid, vitamin C is a small carbohydrate molecule first identified in the 1920s by Albert von Szent Györgyi, who discovered that it was able to prevent and cure scurvy. Scurvy is a pathological life-threatening condition suffered by people who do not have access to fruits or vegetables for long periods of time. A decade earlier, Kazimierz Funk had prepared a list of nutritional factors, called vitamins, whose deficiencies cause severe diseases in humans. In his list, Funk used the letter "C" to designate a factor still unidentified, but known to prevent scurvy. Later on, Szent Györgyi and Haworth chemically identified "C" as ascorbic acid, and named it so because ascorbic means "anti-scurvy." Over the next century, what we now know as vitamin C became one of the most popular drugs in human history.</p>

<p>Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is a water-soluble vitamin. It occurs as a white or slightly yellow crystal or powder with a slight acidic taste. On exposure to light, it gradually darkens. In the dry state, it is reasonably stable in air, but in solution it rapidly oxidizes. It is sparingly  soluble  in  alcohol;
insoluble in chloroform, in ether, and in benzene. </p>

<p>It functions as a redox buffer which can reduce, and thereby and thereby neutralize, reactive oxygen species. It is a cofactor for enzymes involved in regulating photosynthesis, hormone biosynthesis, and regenerating other antioxidants; which also regulates cell division and growth, is involved in signal trans-duction, and has roles in several physiological processes, such as immune stimulation, synthesis of collagen, hormones, neurotrasmitters, and iron absorption, has also roles in detoxifyng the body of heavy metals.</p>

<p>Vitamin C is one of the potent reducing agents and scavenger of free radicals in biological systems, working as a scavenger of oxidizing free radicals and harmful oxygen-derived species, such as hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and singlet oxygen.</p>

<h2>Biosynthesis and molecular structure of vitamin C</h2>

<p>In animals, biosynthesis of vitamin C is included in the glucuronic acid metabolic pathway, which is involved in the metabolism of sugars under normal and disease conditions, and in regulation of physiological functions (Figure 1a). Glucuronic acid metabolic pathway is also an important pathway for detoxification processes. While most animals can convert D-glucose into L-ascorbic acid, humans and other primates, guinea pigs, some fish and birds, and insects are unable to produce ascorbic acid endogenously. The major plant pathway is different from the animal L-ascorbate synthesis pathway that involves 10 enzymatic steps from D-glucose to L-ascorbate via the intermediate formation of GDP-D-mannose and L-galactose.</p>

<p>Vitamin C is a dibasic acid with an enediol group built into a five-membered heterocyclic lactone ring.</p>
