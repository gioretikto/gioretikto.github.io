<h1>Reactions of the carbonyl group with Organometallic Compounds</h1>

<h3>Reaction of an Ester with a Grignard Reagent</h3>

<p>Treating a formic ester with a Grignard reagent followed by hydrolysis gives a secondary alcohol. Treating any other ester with a Grignard reagent gives a tertiary alcohol. The mechanism involves nucleophilic
attack of the Grignard reagent on the carbonyl carbon atom to give a tetrahedral addition intermediate, which collapses with the departure of alkoxide ion to give a ketone intermediate (an aldehyde in the case of formate esters), which reacts with a second mole of Grignard reagent.</p>

<p><b>Step 1: Make a new bond between a nucleophile and an electrophile</b>. The reaction begins with addition of one mole of Grignard reagent to the carbonyl carbon to form a tetrahedral carbonyl addition intermediate.</p>

<p><b>Step 2: Break a bond to give stable molecules or ions</b>. Because an alkoxide ion is a moderately good leaving group from a tetrahedral carbonyl addition intermediate, this intermediate collapses to give a ketone and a magnesium alkoxide salt. To this point in the mechanism, we have nucleophilic acyl substitution.</p>

<p><b>Step 3: Make a new bond between a nucleophile and an electrophile</b>. The ketone reacts with a second mole of Grignard reagent to form a second tetrahedral carbonyl addition compound.</p>

<p><b>Step 4: Add a proton</b>. The chemist adds aqueous acid to the reaction, and the resulting hydrolysis gives a tertiary alcohol. These last two steps constitute nucleophilic acyl addition.</p>

<h2>Organolithium Compounds</h2>

<p>Organolithium compounds are even more powerful nucleophiles than Grignard ­reagents and react with esters to give the same types of secondary and tertiary ­alcohols as shown for Grignard reagents, often in higher yields.</p>
