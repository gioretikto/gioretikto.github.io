<h1>Citric acid</h1>

<p>Citric acid is a weak organic acid that has the chemical formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. It occurs naturally in citrus fruits. In biochemistry, it is an intermediate in the <a href="../biochemistry/krebs.html">citric acid cycle</a>, which occurs in the metabolism of all aerobic organisms.</p>

<p>More than two million tons of citric acid are manufactured every year. It is used widely as an acidifier, as a flavoring and a chelating agent.</p>

<p>A citrate is a derivative of citric acid; that is, the salts, esters, and the polyatomic anion found in solution. An example of the former, a salt is trisodium citrate; an ester is triethyl citrate. When part of a salt, the formula of the citrate anion is written as C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sup>3−</sup><sub>7</sub> or C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O(COO)<sup>3−</sup><sub>3</sub>. </p>

<p>Citric acid exists in a variety of fruits and vegetables, most notably citrus fruits. Lemons and limes have particularly high concentrations of the acid; it can constitute as much as 8% of the dry weight of these fruits (about 47 g/l in the juices). The concentrations of citric acid in citrus fruits range from 0.005 mol/L for oranges and grapefruits to 0.30 mol/L in lemons and limes; these values vary within species depending upon the cultivar and the circumstances in which the fruit was grown. </p>

<p>Global production was in excess of 2,000,000 tons in 2018. More than 50% of this volume was produced in China. More than 50% was used as an <b>acidity regulator</b> in beverages, some 20% in other food applications, 20% for detergent applications, and 10% for applications other than food, such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and in the chemical industry. Because it is one of the stronger edible acids, the dominant use of citric acid is as a flavoring and preservative in food and beverages, especially soft drinks and candies. Within the European Union it is denoted by E number <b>E330</b>. Citrate salts of various metals are used to deliver those minerals in a biologically available form in many dietary supplements. Citric acid can be added to ice cream as an emulsifying agent to keep fats from separating, to caramel to prevent sucrose crystallization, or in recipes in place of fresh lemon juice.</p>

<h2>Antimicrobial properties</h2>

<p>The partition coefficient for citric acid is —0.172 (Leo et al., 1971) showing that this acid is not lipophilic. Research into the uptake of citric acid by yeast showed that this acid “hardly entered cells at all” (Suomalainen and Oura, 1955) and is
thus extremely unlikely to inhibit by lowering cytoplasmic pH. The low lipid solubility also effectively eliminates the membrane as a site of action. The antimicrobial action of citric acid, by default, must lie outside of the membrane.</p>

<p>The most probable primary action by citric acid is as an acidulant, lowering the pH of the cellular medium. Juven (1976) showed that the antimicrobial concentrations of citric acid at pH 3 were comparable with those of hydrochloric acid, suggesting an effect by acidity alone. An action as a chelating agent is also possible with citric acid (Table 4.3) which binds a number of metal ions with moderate affinity. Such an action will only be significant at high pH and in media low in metal ion content. Chelation by citric acid may remove metal ions essential for microbial growth (Rammell, 1962; Imai et al., 1970; Branen and Keenan, 1970). Calcium and magnesium chelation were proposed as critical metal ions removed by citric acid, in the inhibition of Clostridium botulinum (Graham and Lund, 1986) while Shelef (1994) suggested a role for citric acid in the chelation of Fe**. Citrate was shown to
aid inhibition of lactic acid bacteria by monolaurin (Blaszyk and Holley, 1998) although this was not found with other Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria (Oh and Marshall, 1994; Razavi-Rohani and Griffiths, 1994).</p>
