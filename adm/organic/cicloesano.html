<h2>Conformations</h2>

<p>X-ray and electron diffraction experiments clearly prove that cyclohexane exists almost exclusively in the chair conformation. An examination of the model (Dreiding, Fieser, or Prentice-Hall) of the cyclohexane chair shows that it is devoid of any kind of strain. In an ideal chair, the bond angles are 109°28’, ie., E<sub>&alpha;</sub> = 0; there is no bond length distortion, i.e... E<sub>l</sub>=0; all the bonds are staggered (&theta; = 60°), i.e. E<sub>&theta;</sub> = 0, and there is no non-bonded interaction. In fact, the chair form lies at the bottom of a deep energy well and any deviation therefrom is strongly resisted by internal forces. The structure is rigid and the rigidity can be felt even in the model which unlike that of n-butane resists easy rotation around single bonds.</p>

<p>The characteristics of the cyclohexane chair are best described under the following headings:</p>

<h3>Geometry</h3>

<p>The electron diffraction experiments of cyclohexane in the gaseous phase (Geise et al 1971) show the following geometric parameters:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>C—C bond length = 0.1528 nm (152.8 pm)</p></li>
	<li><p>C—H bond length = 0.1119 nm (111.9 pm)</p></li>
	<li><p>C—C—C bond angle = 111°0S’ (instead of 109°28’)</p></li>
	<li><p>Dihedral angle (as shown in Ia) = 56° (instead of 60°)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The increased C—C—C bond angle makes the chair conformation slightly flattened* so that the dihedral angles between adjacent C—C bonds are 56° and
the vertical C—H bonds (axial) are not exactly parallel to the C, axis but lean outwards from it by 7°. The chair form is drawn in three different perspectives (Figure 10.1). The structure (1) shows the conventional drawing of the chair with the C; axis vertical and the six carbon atoms distributed in two parallel horizontal planes, 1-3-5 in one and 2-4-6 in the other separated by a distance of 0.05 nm. Any consecutive four carbon atoms form a gauche butane unit and since there are six such units (1-2-3-4, 2-3-4-5, 3-4-5-6 etc.), the enthalphy of cyclohexane chair may be computed as 3.3 * 6 or 19.8 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> with respect to a hypothetical all-anti chair conformationt.</p>

<p>Two other nonchair conformations of cyclohexane that have normal bond angles and bond lengths are the twist and the boat conformations. Both the twist and the boat conformations are less stable than the chair. Molecular mechanics calculations indicate that the twist conformation is about 5 kcal/mol, and the boat about 6.4 kcal/mol, higher in energy than the chair. A direct measurement of the chair-twist energy difference has been made using low-temperature IR spectroscopy.*° The chair was determined to be 5.5kcal/mol lower in enthalpy than the twist. The twist and boat conformations are more flexible than the chair but are destabilized by torsional strain. In addition, the boat conformation is further destabilized by a van der Waals repulsion between the “flagpole” hydrogens, which are separated from each other by about 1.83 Å, a distance considerably less than the sum of their van der Waals radii of 2.4 Å.</p>

<p>Interconversion of chair forms is known as conformational inversion and occurs by rotation about carbon-carbon bonds. For cyclohexane, the first-order rate constant for ring inversion is 104-105 s~' at 300K. The enthalpy of activation is 10.8kcal/mol.”! Calculation of the geometry of the transition state by molecular mechanics suggests a half-twist form lying 12.0kcal/mol above the chair. The transition state incorporates 0.2 kcal/mol of compression energy from bond deformation, 2.0 kcal/mol of bond-angle strain, 4.4 kcal/mol of van der Waals strain, and 5.4 kcal/mol of torsional strain.® Figure 3.4 presents an energy diagram illustrating the process of conformational inversion in cyclohexane. The boat form is not shown in the diagram, because the chair forms can interconvert without passing through the boat. The boat lies 1-2 kcal/mol above the twist conformation and is a transition state for interconversion of twist forms.</p>

<p>Substitution on a cyclohexane ring does not greatly affect the rate of conformational inversion but does change the equilibrium distribution between alternative chair forms. All substituents that are axial in one chair conformation become equatorial on ring inversion, and vice versa. For methylcyclohexane, &Delta;G° for the equilibrium is —1.8kcal/mol, corresponding to a composition with 95% of the equatorial methyl conformation. Two factors contribute to the preference for the equatorial conformation. The equatorial methyl conformation corresponds to an anti arrangement with respect to the C(2)—C(3) and C(6)—C(5) bonds, whereas the axial methyl group is in a gauche relationship to these bonds. We have seen earlier that the gauche conformation of n-butane is 0.8 kcal/mol higher in energy than the anti conformation. In addition, there is a van der Waals repulsion between the axial methyl group and the axial hydrognes at C-3 and C-5. Interactions of this type are called <i>1,3-diaxial interactions</i>. Energy differences between conformations of substituted cyclohexanes can be measures by several physical methods, as can the kinetcs of the ring inversion processes. NMR spectroscopy has been especially valuable for both thermodynamic and kinetic studies. In NMR terminology, the transformation of an equatorial substituent to axial and vice versa is called a <i>site exchange process</i>. Depending on the rate of the process, the difference between the chemical shifts of the nucleus at the two sites, and the field strenght of the spectrometer, the spectrum will be either a weighted-average spectrum (rapid site exchange, <i>k &gt; 10<sup>5</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) or a superposition of the spectra of the two conformers reflecting the conformational composition (slow site exhange <i>k &lt; 10<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). At intermediate rates of exchange, broadened spectra are observed. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the spectra can lead to the activation parameters for the conformational process.
