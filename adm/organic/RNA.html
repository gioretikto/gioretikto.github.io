<h1>RNA</h1>

<p>RNA polymerases enzymes, function only in the presence of DNA, which serves as the template upon which single-stranded RNA chains are made, and use the nucleotides ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP as precursors
. Thymine in DNA is replaced by uracil, and ribose replaces deoxyribose in RNA.</p>

<p>An mRNA molecule may be produced for each gene or group of genes that is to be expressed in E. coli, whereas a distinct mRNA is produced for each gene in eukaryotes.</p>

<p>During transcription, only one of the two strands of DNA is used as a template to make RNA. This makes sense, because the messages carried by the two strands, being complementary but not identical, are expected to code for completely different polypeptides (some genes use one strand, while others use the opposite strand).</p>

<p>The synthesis of RNA is like that of DNA in several respects. First, the RNA is always synthesized in the 5′ → 3′ direction. Second, the mechanism of elongation is similar: the 3'-OH group at the terminus of the growing chain makes a nucleophilic attack on the innermost phosphoryl group of the incoming nucleoside triphosphate. Third, the synthesis is driven forward by the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate. In contrast with DNA polymerase, however, RNA polymerase does not require a primer. In addition, the ability of RNA polymerase to correct mistakes is not as extensive as that of DNA polymerase.</p>
