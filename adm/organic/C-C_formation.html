<p><b>Nucleophilic displacement of a leaving group by a carbon nucleophile</b>

<ul>
	<li><p>Gilman (organocuprate) reagents (Section 15.2C), if the leaving group is a halogen atom or toylate.</p></li>

<p>This list already includes many different reactions, but you will find that the new reactions in this chapter are of somewhat different character. <br>None of the C−C bond-forming reactions summarized above are catalytic. Recall that a catalyst is a species that becomes involved in the mechanism of a reaction and lowers the barrier to that reaction, thereby accelerating the reaction rate. Catalysts do not change the thermodynamics of a reaction, but instead they alter the kinetics. Further, a catalyst is regenerated at the end of the reaction in the same form as at the start of the reaction, and hence, a catalyst is available to be used over and over—a property that is often referred to as “turn-over.” This chapter focuses on catalytic C−C bond-forming reactions. In other words, a chemical (the catalyst) is added to the reaction vessel and causes C−C bond formation in a manner that is faster than would occur in the absence of the catalyst. In fact, most of the reactions we examine in this chapter (particularly those of Section 24.5) would essentially never occur without the catalyst. The catalytic processes we examine are reasonably new compared to many of those discussed in this book, and the ones
we examine all involve organometallic catalysts. Consequently, we start the chapter with a brief overview of the key reactions performed by organometallic compounds.</p>

<h2>Organometallic Compounds and Catalysis</h2>

<p>We introduced organometallic compounds in Chapter 15. In the next few sections, we discuss several reactions of transition metals that are particularly useful for preparation of new carbon-carbon bonds.</p>

<h3>Oxidative Addition and Reductive Elimination</h3>

<p>Two extremely important reactions of transition metals and transition metal compounds are oxidative addition and its reverse reductive elimination. In <b>oxidative addition</b>, a reagent adds to a metal, causing its coordination to increase by two; <b>reductive elimination</b> is the opposite. These reactions are called oxidative or reductive because the formal charge of the metal changes by two during the reaction. Oxidative addition can occur with a metal coordinated with one or more <b>ligands</b> (L<sub>n</sub>, where <i>n</i> is the number); it can also occur with a free metal, M(0). Haloalkanes, hydrogen, halogens, and many other types of compounds can take part in these reactions. The reactivity of different substrates depends greatly on the metal.</p>

<tr><td>ML<sub>n</sub></td> <td>+</td> <td>X<sub>2</sub></td> <td>oxidative addition<br>⇌<br>reductive elimination</td> <td>X<sub>2</sub>ML<sub>n</sub></td> </tr>
</table>

<p>Although there are numerous other reactions that are unique and essential to the action of organometallic catalysts, the key steps of the catalytic processes we discuss in this chapter involve oxidative additions and reductive eliminations. Thus, in an introductory chapter on catalytic C−C bond-forming reactions, we need go no deeper.</p>

<h2>Key Features of the Utility of Catalytic C−C Bond Formation</h2>

<p id="green">The reactions and mechanisms covered in this chapter represent a growing modern trend in organic chemistry. Organometallic catalysts facilitate reactions that are otherwise impossible, are very difficult, or would require many synthetic steps in order to accomplish. The use of these catalysts causes a net decrease in the number and quantity of reagents, solvents, and purifi cations necessary in an overall synthetic sequence. This decrease means that the chemical waste from an industrial process can be dramatically reduced. Intentionally designing a chemical procedure or process so as to decrease waste and toxic byproducts is now a whole chemical field in and of itself that is called <b>green chemistry</b>.<br> It is a goal of green chemistry to use effectively each of the atoms involved in a reaction so that atoms are not “thrown away” by being incorporated into byprod- ucts of the reactions. This concept is called <b>atom economy</b>, which describes the efficiency of a chemical process in terms of all the atoms involved. An ideal reaction would consist of the mass of the product equaling the mass of all the reactants used. In such a case, each atom of the reactants would be completely incorporated into the product, and no waste would be generated. Such reactions are rare, but the goal of achieving the highest atom economy clearly has both an environmental and economic benefit. Hence, “going green” is permeating society in many ways, with the chemical industry recognizing and embracing the value of green.</p>
