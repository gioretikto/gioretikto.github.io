<h1>Lipids</h1>

<p>Lipids (Greek: λίπος, fat) are the fourth major group of molecules found in all cells. Unlike nucleic acids, proteins, and polysaccharides, lipids are not polymeric. However, they do aggregate, and it is in this state that they perform their central function as the structural matrix of biological membranes. Lipids exhibit greater structural variety than the other classes of biological molecules. To a certain extent, lipids constitute a catchall category of substances that are similar only in that they are largely hydrophobic and only sparingly soluble in water. In general, lipids perform three biological functions (although certain lipids serve more than one purpose in some cells):</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Lipid molecules in the form of lipid bilayers are essential components of biological membranes.</p></li>
	<li><p>Lipids containing hydrocarbon chains serve as energy stores.</p></li>
	<li><p>Many intra- and intercellular signaling events involve lipid molecules.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Lipids are substances of biological origin that are soluble in organic solvents such as chloroform and methanol. Hence, they are easily separated from other biological materials by extraction into organic solvents. They can then be separated chromatographically and identified by mass spectrometry according to their masses and characteristic fragmentation patterns. Fats, oils, certain vitamins and hormones, and most nonprotein membrane components are lipids. In this section, we discuss the structures and physical properties of the major classes of lipids.</p>

<h2>Fatty acids</h2>

<p>Long-chain carboxylic acids, often referred to as <b>fatty acids</b>, are stored by living organisms by combining them with glycerol to produce tri-esters called <a href="triacylglycerols.html">triglycerides</a>. <br> They usually occur in esterified form as major components of the various lipids described in this chapter. In higher plants and animals, the predominant fatty acid residues are those of the C<sub>16</sub> and C<sub>18</sub> species: <b>palmitic, oleic, linoleic</b>, and <b>stearic acids</b>. Fatty acids with &lt;14 or &gt;20 carbon atoms are uncommon. Most fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms because they are biosynthesized by the concatenation of C<sub>2</sub> units.</p>

</figure>

<p>Over half of the fatty acid residues of plant and animal lipids are <b>unsaturated</b> (contain double bonds) and are often <b>polyunsaturated</b> (contain two or more double bonds). Bacterial fatty acids are rarely polyunsaturated but are commonly branched, hydroxylated, or contain cyclopropane rings. The first double bond of an unsaturated fatty acid commonly occurs between its C9 and C10 atoms counting from the carboxyl C atom. This bond is called a Δ<sup>9</sup> - or 9-double bond. In polyunsaturated fatty acids, the double bonds tend to occur at every third carbon atom (e.g., —CH=CH— CH<sub>2</sub> —CH=CH—) and so are not conjugated (as in —CH=CH—CH=CH—). Two important classes of polyunsaturated fatty acids are designated as ω–3 or ω–6 fatty acids, a nomenclature that identifi es the last double-bonded carbon atom as counted from the methyl terminal (ω) end of the chain. α-Linolenic acid and linoleic acid (Fig. 9-1) are examples of such fatty acids.</p>

<p><b>Saturated fatty acids</b> (which are fully reduced or “saturated” with hydrogen) are highly flexible molecules that can assume a wide range of conformations because there is relatively free rotation around each of their C—C bonds. Nevertheless, their lowest energy conformation is the fully extended conformation, which has the least amount of steric interference between neighboring methylene groups. The melting points (mp) of saturated fatty acids, like those of most substances, increase with their molecular mass (Table 9-1). Fatty acid double bonds almost always have the cis configuration.<br> This puts a rigid 30° bend in the hydrocarbon chain. Consequently, unsaturated fatty acids pack together less effi ciently than saturated fatty acids. The reduced van der Waals interactions of unsaturated fatty acids cause their melting points to decrease with the degree of unsaturation. The fl uidity of lipids containing fatty acid residues likewise increases with the degree of unsaturation of the fatty acids. This phenomenon, as we will see, has important consequences for biological membranes.</p>

<p>I doppi legami degli acidi grassi sono quasi sempre in conformazione cis. Tale cisrcostanza impone una curvatura rigida di 30° nella catena idrocarburica; in conseguenza, gli acidi grassi insaturi si addensano con minore efficienza rispetto a quelli saturi. All common <i>cis</i> unsaturated fatty acids are liquids at room temperature because the <i>cis</i> double bonds interrupt the regular packing of the chains and the London dispersion forces act over only shorter segments of the chains, so that less energy is required to melt them. The greater the degree of unsaturation, the lower the melting point, because each double bond introduces more disorder into the packing of the fatty acid molecules.</p>

<p>Following are several characteristics of the most abundant fatty acids in higher plants and animals.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Nearly all fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, most between 12 and 20, in an unbranched chain.</p></li>
<li><p>The three most abundant fatty acids in nature are palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0), and oleic acid (18:1).</p></li>
<li><p>In most unsaturated fatty acids, the cis isomer predominates; the trans isomer is rare.</p></li>
<li><p>Unsaturated fatty acids have lower melting points than their saturated counterparts. The greater the degree of unsaturation, the lower the melting point  Compare, for example, the melting points of linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, and stearic acid, a saturated fatty acid.</p></li>

<h3>Nomenclatura</h3>

<p>The three major classes of unsaturated fatty acids (omega-3, -6, and -9) derive their names from the number of carbons from the methyl end at which the first double bond appears.</p>

<h2>Stability</h2>

<p>Saturation influences stability. Fats can become <b>rancid</b> when exposed to oxygen. Polyunsaturated fatty acids spoil most readly because their double bonds are unstable. The <b>oxidation</b> of unsaturated fats produces a variety of compounds that smell and taste rancid; saturated fats are more resistant to oxidation and thus less likely to become rancid. Other types of spoilage can occur due to microbial growth, however.</p>

<p>Manufacterers can protect fat-containing products against rancidity in thress ways - none of them perfect. First, products may be sealed airtight and refrigerated - an expensive and inconvinient storage system. Second, manufacterers may add <b>antioxidants</b> to compete for the oxygen and thus protect the oil (examples are the additives <b>BHA</b> and <b>BH/</b> and vitamins C and E). Thirs manufacterers may saturate some or all of the points of unsaturation by adding hydrogen atoms - a process known as <b>hydrogenation</b>.</p>

<h2>Hydrogenation</h2>

<p>Hydrogenation offers two advantages: it protects oxidation (thereby prolonging shelf life= and also offer the texture of foods by increasing the solidity of fats. When partially hydrogenated, vegetable oils become spreadable margarine Hydrogenated fats make piecrusts flaky and puddings creamy. A disavantage is that hydrogenation makes polyunsaturated fats more saturated. Consequenlty, any healy advantages of using polyunsaturated fats is lost in hydrogentaion.</p>

<h2>Essential Fatty Acids</h2>

<p>The human body can synthesize all the fatty acids it needs from carbohydrate, fat, or protein except for two - <b>linoleic acid</b> and <b>linolenic acid</b>. Both acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids. Because they cannot be made from other substanes in the body, the must be obtained from food and are therefore called <b>essential fatty acids</b>. They are found in small amounts in plant oils, and the body readily stores them, making deficiency unlikely. From both of these essential fatty acids, the body makes important substances that help regulate a wide range of body functions: blood pressure, clot formation, blood lipid concentration, the immune response, the inflammatory response to injusry, and many others. These two essential nutrients also serve as structural components of cell membranes.</p>
