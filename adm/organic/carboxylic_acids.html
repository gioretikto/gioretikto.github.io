<p><b>Carboxylic acids</b> also are major products of biochemistry occurring under oxidizing conditions and are thus widespread throughout living systems on Earth. You are probably familiar with the
bottle of wine that has turned to vinegar, the result of enzymatic oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid. Carboxylic acids are characterized by the presence of the carboxy group, a functional group containing
a hydroxy unit attached to a carbonyl carbon. This substituent is written COOH or CO<sub>2</sub>H; both representations are used in this chapter. Carboxylic acids not only are widely distributed in nature, they are also important industrial chemicals. For example, besides being the most important building block in the assembly of complex biological molecules, acetic acid is an industrial commodity that is
produced in very large quantities. <br>Much of the functional behavior of carboxylic acids can be anticipated if we view them structurally as hydroxy carbonyl derivatives. Thus, the hydroxy hydrogen is acidic, the oxygens are basic and nucleophilic, and the carbonyl carbon is subject to nucleophilic attack.</p>

<h2 id="IUPAC">Nomenclature - IUPAC System</h2>

<p>The IUPAC name of a carboxylic acid is derived from that of the longest carbon chain that contains the carboxyl group by dropping the final -<i>e</i> from the name of the parent alkane and adding the suffix -<i>oic</i> followed by the word acid (Section 2.3C). The chain is numbered beginning with the carbon of the carboxyl group. Because the carboxyl carbon is understood to be carbon 1, there is no need to give it a number. The IUPAC system retains the common names <i>formic acid</i> and <i>acetic acid</i>, which are always used to refer to these acids.</p>

<table class="noborder centertable">
<tr><td>HCOOH<br>Methanoic acid<br>(Formic acid)</td> <td>CH<sub>3</sub>COOH<br>Ethanoic acid<br>(Acetic acid)</td> <td><img src="img/3-Methylbutanoic_acid.png" alt="3-Methylbutanoic_acid.png"><br>3-Methylbutanoic acid<br>(Isovaleric acid)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If the carboxylic acid contains a carbon-carbon double or triple bond, change the infix from -<i>an- to -en- or -yn</i>-, as the case may be, to indicate the presence of the multiple bond and show the location of the multiple bond by a number.</p>

<table class="noborder centertable">

</table>

<h2 id="nom">Naming the Carboxylic Acids and polyfunctional Compounds groups</h2>

<p>In the IUPAC system, a <b>carboxyl group</b> takes precedence over most other f­ unctional groups (Table 16.1), including hydroxyl groups, amino groups, and the carbonyl groups of aldehydes and ketones. As illustrated in the following examples, an −OH group is indicated by the prefix <i>hydroxy</i>-; an −NH<sub>2</sub> group, by <i>amino</i>-; and the C=O group of an aldehyde or ketone, by <i>oxo</i>-</p>

<table class="noborder centertable">
<tr><td><img src="img/(R)-5-Hydroxyhexanoic_acid.png" alt="(R)-5-Hydroxyhexanoic acid"/><br>(R)-5-Hydroxyhexanoic acid</td> <td><img src="img/5-Oxohexanoic_acid.png" alt="5-Oxohexanoic acid"/><br>5-Oxohexanoic acid</td> 

<td><img src="img/4-Aminobutanoic_acid.png" alt="4-Aminobutanoic_acid.png"/><br>4-Aminobutanoic_acid.png</td></tr>

</table> 

<table class="noborder centertable">
<tr><td><img src="img/5-Oxohexanal.png" alt="5-oxo hexanal"/></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">5-Oxohexanal</td>
<tr><td>5-Oxo (Substituent)</td> <td>al (Suffix)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The overall “order of precedence” of the most common functional groups is given below. In any molecule containing more than one functional group, the group highest in precedence is entered as a suffix in the name, and all other substituents as prefixes. <br> As another example consider a molecule containing alcohol, ketone, and aldehyde functions.</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/5-Hydroxy-4-oxopentanal.png" alt="5-Hydroxy-4-oxopentanal"/>
<figcaption>5-Hydroxy-4-oxopentanal</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In its name, the first two groups appear as prefixes (hydroxy- and oxo-, respectively), while the aldehyde group, being of highest precedence, is signified by the suffix -<i>al</i>: This compound is 5-Hydroxy-4-oxopentanal. <br>Alkenes and alkynes are exceptions. They rank below the amines in order of precedence, but when a carbon – carbon double or triple bond is part of the parent chain or ring of a molecule, we insert -<i>en(e)</i>- or -<i>yn(e)</i>- just before the suffix for the highest-ranking functional group. The following examples of names for carboxylic acids illustrate these principles.</p>

<table class="noborder centertable">
<tr><td><img src="img/Carboxylic_acid.png" alt="Carboxylic Acid"/><br>Carboxylic<br> acid</td> <td>&gt;</td> <td><img src="img/Acid_anhydride.png" alt="acid Anhydride"/><br>Acid Anhydride</td> <td>&gt;</td>
<td><img src="img/Ester.png" alt="Ester"/><br>Ester</td> <td>&gt;</td> <td><img src="img/Acyl_halide.png" alt="Acyl halide"/><br>Acyl halide</td> <td>&gt;</td> <td><img src="img/Amide.png" alt="Amide"/><br>Amide</td> <td>&gt;</td> <td>RCN<br>Nitrile</td> <td>&gt;</td> <td><img src="img/Aldehyde.png" alt="Aldehyde"/><br>Aldehyde</td> <td>&gt;</td> <td><img src="img/Ketone.png" alt="Ketone"/><br>Ketone</td> <td>&gt;</td> <td>ROH<br>Alcohol</td> <td>&gt;</td> <td>RSH</td> <td>&gt;RNH<sub>2</sub></td> <td>&gt;</td> <td>R−O−R'<br>ether</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="11">⟵ <b>Increasing precedence in naming</b></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The IUPAC system derives the names of the carboxylic acids by replacing the ending -<i>e</i> in the name of the alkane by -<b>oic acid</b>. The alkanoic acid stem is numbered by assigning
the number 1 to the carboxy carbon and labeling any substituents along the longest chain incorporating the CO<sub>2</sub>H group accordingly.</p>

<table class="noborder centertable">
<tr><td><img src="img/(R)-2-Bromopropanoic_acid.png" alt="(R)-2-Bromopropanoic acid"/><br>(R)-2-<b>Bromo</b>propan<b>oic acid</b><br>(&alpha;-Bromopropionic acid)</td> <td>CH<sub>2</sub>=CHCOOH<br>Propen<b>oic acid</b> <br>(Acrylic acid)</td> <td><img src="img/(2R,3S)-Dimethylpentanoic_acid.png" alt="(2R,3S)-Dimethylpentanoic acid"/><br>(2R,3S)-Dimethylpentan<b>oic acid</b></td></tr>
</table>

<p>In multiply functionalized carboxylic acids, the main chain is chosen to include other functional groups as much as possible (the functional group that did not receive the priority). For example</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/3-Ethyl-4-oxopentanoic_acid.png" alt="3-ethyl-4-oxopentanoic acid"/>
<figcaption>3-Ethyl-4-oxopentanoic acid</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Saturated cyclic acids are named as <b>cycloalkane-carboxylic acids</b>. Their aromatic counterparts are the benzoic acids. In these compounds, the carbon attached to the carboxy functional group is C1.</p>

<table id="suffix">

<p>When assigning locants, the functional group in the suffix should be assigned the lowest possible number, for example:</p>

<figcaption>4-hydroxy-4-methylpentan-2-one<br>(diacetone alcohol)</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="di">Dicarboxylic acids</h2>

<p>Dicarboxylic acids are named by adding the suffix -dioic acid to the name of the carbon chain that contains both carboxyl groups. The numbers of the carboxyl carbons are not indicated because they can be only at the ends of the parent chain. Following are IUPAC and common names for several important aliphatic dicarboxylic acids.</p>

<table class="noborder centertable">
<tr><td><img src="img/Oxalic_acid.png" alt="Oxalic acid"/> <br> Ethanedioic acid (Oxalic acid)</td> <td><img src="img/Malonic_acid.png" alt="Malonic acid"/>Propanedioic acid

</table>

<p>The name <i>oxalic acid </i>is derived from one of its sources in the biological world, namely plants of the genus <i>Oxalis</i>, one of which is rhubarb. Adipic acid is one of the two monomers required for the synthesis of the polymer <a href="condensation_polymers.html">nylon 66</a>. A mnemonic phrase for remembering the common names for the dicarboxylic acids oxalic through adipic is <i>Oh my, such good apples</i>.<br> A carboxylic acid containing a carboxyl group bonded to a cycloalkane ring is named by giving the name of the ring and adding the suffix -<i>carboxylic acid.</i> The ­atoms of the ring are numbered beginning with the carbon bearing the −COOH group.</p>
