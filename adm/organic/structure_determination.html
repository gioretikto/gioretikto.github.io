<h1>X-ray crystallography</h1>

<p>The determination of macromolecular structure (specifically of nucleic acids and proteins) is of crucial importance in many areas of molecular biology and provides important insights into biological function. This information is vital in many areas of biochemistry, biology and medicine. To date, X-ray crystallography has provided the most detailed and precise information about protein structure (Blundell and Johnson 1976). Crystal structures have been determined to atomic resolution less than 1.0 Å. Although X-ray crystallographic techniques often provide precise structural information, the application of these techniques is not always possible or appropriate. One limitation on the applicability of X-ray methodology is that many proteins do not form crystals of sufficient size or quality for crystallographic analysis. Another limitation is that X-ray structures provide information about proteins in their crystalline state which may differ from their native state in solution.</p>

<p>Moreoverm, it is not known whether the identified crystal structures match the structures of proteins in solution. The crystal structures almost certainly deviate from the solution structures in one respect: they conceal the potential mobility of a protein’s constituent structures.</p>

<p>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides information from which protein structures can be determined. NMR methods do not require protein crystals, although high protein concentrations (~1-10 mM) are needed. Unfortunately, detailed interpretation 
of NMR structural information is difficult, and determining protein structures from NMR data often requires extensive computational 
efforts. Also, sufficient NMR information to allow a structure to be determined precisely is often not available. In spite of 
these limitations, NMR data coupled with appropriate commputational tools can be used to deternine protein solution structures.
The detennination of solution structures by NMR methods can be divided into three major steps: data gatherin; spectral assignments, and structure generation. Data gathering; and spectral assigrunent techniques will be discussed briefly. This chapter concentrates 
on the strategy and techniques used to generate protein structures from NMR data and PROI'E'AN, an Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) system that implements this strategy. </p>

<p>The detennination of protein structures by NMR is erformed in a hierarchical and sequential fashion. The first step is to obtain 
the relevant NMR spectra. Two dimensional NMR methods require =10-20 Jrg of purified sanp1e and are limited to proteins of molecular weight &lt; 20,000. Spectral resonances are identified by a equential assigrunent method which relies on a prior knowledge of the prilnary structure. The secondary structure is then determined from measurements of amide proton exchange rates, short rang-a 
Nuclear ovemauser Effects (NOEs) and scaler couplin;J constants. Finally, the tertiaJ:y structure is detennined by positionin;J 
the secorx3axy structures usin;J the NOE constraints between the secondary structures. </p>
