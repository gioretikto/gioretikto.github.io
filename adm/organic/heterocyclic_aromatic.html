<h1>Heterocyclic Aromatic Compounds</h1>

<p>Aromatic character is not limited to hydrocarbons; it is found in <b>heterocyclic compounds</b> as well. Pyridine and pyrimidine are heterocyclic analogs of benzene. In pyridine, one CH group of benzene is replaced by nitrogen, and, in pyrimidine, two CH groups are replaced by nitrogens.</p>

<p>Pyridine is a weak base (pK<sub>a</sub> = 5.21) due to the presence of lone pair of electrons on nitrogen. Pyridine behaves as a typical tertiary amine. In acidic medium, it forms <i>pyridinium salts</i>. It is much weaker base than <a href="amines_basicity.html">aliphatic amines</a>, mainly because of the different hybridization of the nitroge (<i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> in pyridine and <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> in aliphatic amines). The greater <i>s</i>-character of the orbital containing the basic nonbonded lone pair (one-third <i>s</i> in pyridine and one-fourth <i>s</i> in aliphatic amines) means that the unshared electron pair is held closer to the nitrogen nucleus in pyridine, decreasing its basicity. </p>

<p>Each molecule meets the Hückel criteria for aromaticity. Each is monocyclic and planar, each has one 2<i>p</i> orbital on each atom of the ring, and each has six electrons in the &pi; system. In pyridine, nitrogen is sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized, and its unshared pair of electrons occupies an sp<sup>2</sup> orbital in the plane of the ring and is perpendicular to the 2<i>p</i> orbitals of the &pi; system; thus, the unshared pair on the nitrogen of pyridine is not a part of the &pi; system (Figure 21.10). <br> In pyrimidine, neither unshared pair of electrons of nitrogen is part of the &pi; system. The resonance energy of pyridine is estimated to be 134 kJ (32 kcal)/mol, slightly less than that of benzene. The resonance energy of pyrimidine is estimated to be 108 kJ (26 kcal)/mol. The five-membered ring heterocyclic compounds furan, thiophene, pyrrole, and imidazole are also aromatic.</p>

<p>In these planar compounds, each heteroatom is sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized, and its unhybridized 2<i>p</i> orbital is part of a closed loop of fi ve 2p orbitals. In furan and thiophene, one unshared pair of electrons of the heteroatom lies in the unhybridized 2p orbital and is a part of the &pi; system (Figure 21.11). The other unshared pair of electrons lies in an sp<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbital perpendicular to the 2<i>p</i> orbitals and is not part of the &pi; system. In pyrrole, the unshared pair of electrons on nitrogen is part of the &pi; system. In imidazole, the unshared pair on one nitrogen is part of the aromatic sextet, and the unshared pair on the other nitrogen is not. <br> Nature abounds with compounds having a heterocyclic ring fused to one or more other rings. </p>


<p>The pyrrolium cation has pK<sub>a</sub> −3.8 can be considered a very strong acid, and thus pyrrole is not at all basic.</p>





<p>Two such compounds especially important in the biological world are indole and purine.</p>

<p>Indole contains a pyrrole ring fused with a benzene ring. Compounds derived from indole include the essential <a href="amino_acids.html">amino acid</a> L-tryptophan and the neurotransmitter serotonin. Purine contains a six-membered pyrimidine ring fused with a five-membered imidazole ring. Caffeine is a trimethyl derivative of an oxidized purine. Compounds derived from purine and pyrimidine are building blocks of deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) and ribonucleic acids RNA,.</p>
