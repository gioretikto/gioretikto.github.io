<h1>Electrophilic aromatic substitution</h1>

<p>In an electrophilic aromatic substitution, a hydrogen atom of an aromatic ring is replaced by an electrophile, E<sup>+</sup>. We study several common types of electrophiles, like Br<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>+</sup>, etc, how each is generated, and the mechanism by which it replaces hydrogen on an aromatic ring. </p>

<p>Before seeing how electrophilic aromatic substitutions occur, let’s briefly recall what we said about <a href="alkene_addition_HX.html">electrophilic alkene additions</a>. When a reagent such as HCl adds to an alkene, the electrophilic hydrogen approaches the &pi; electrons of the double bond and forms a bond to one carbon, leaving a posi­tive charge at the other carbon. This carbocation intermediate then reacts with the nucleophilic Cl<sub>2</sub> ion to yield the addition product.</p>

<p>Chlorine alone does not react with benzene, in contrast to its instantaneous addition to cyclohexene. However, in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as ferric chloride or aluminum chloride (Section 4.7), benzene reacts with chlorine to give chlorobenzene and HCl. For bromination of benzene to take place, a catalyst such as FeBr<sub>3</sub> is needed. The catalyst makes the Br<sub>2</sub> molecule more electrophilic by polarizing it to give an FeBr<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>Br<sup>+</sup> species that reacts as if it were Br<sup>+</sup>. The polarized Br<sub>2</sub> mole­cule then reacts with the nucleophilic benzene ring to yield a nonaromatic carbocation intermediate that is doubly allylic (Section 11.5) and has three resonance forms.</p>

<p>Although more stable than a typical alkyl carbocation because of resonance, the intermediate in electrophilic aromatic substitution is nevertheless much less stable than the starting benzene ring itself, with its 150 kJ/mol (36 kcal/mol) of aromatic stability. Thus, the reaction of an electrophile with a benzene ring is endergonic, has a substantial activation energy, and is rather slow. Figure 16.1 shows an energy diagram comparing the reaction of an electrophile with an alkene and with benzene. The benzene reaction is slower (higher &Delta;G<sup>‡</sup>) because the starting material is more stable.</p>

<p>Another difference between alkene addition and aromatic substitution occurs after the carbocation intermediate has formed. Instead of adding Br<sub>2</sub> to give an addition product, the carbocation intermediate loses H<sup>+</sup> from the bromine-bearing carbon to give a substitution product. Note that this loss of H<sup>+</sup> is similar to what occurs in the second step of an E1 reaction (Section 11.10). The net effect of reaction of Br<sub>2</sub> with benzene is the substitution of H<sup>+</sup> by Br<sup>+</sup> by the overall mechanism shown in Figure 16.2.</p>
 
<p>Why does the reaction of Br<sub>2</sub> with benzene take a different course than its reaction with an alkene? The answer is straightforward. If addition occurred, the 150 kJ/mol stabilization energy of the aromatic ring would be lost and the over­ all reaction would be endergonic. When substitution occurs, though, the stabil­ ity of the aromatic ring is retained and the reaction is exergonic. An energy diagram for the overall process is shown in Figure 16.3.</p>

<p>Reaction between chlorine and the Lewis acid catalyst gives a molecular complex with a positive charge on chlorine and a negative charge on iron. Redistribution of electrons in this complex generates a bromonium ion, Br<sup>+</sup>, a very strong electrophile, as part of an ion pair.</p>

<p>Treating benzene with bromine in the presence of ferric chloride or aluminum chloride gives bromobenzene and HBr. The mechanism of this reaction is the same as that for the chlorination of benzene. The first and rate-determining step is attack of the strong electrophile, E<sup>+</sup>, by the weakly nucleophilic &pi; electrons of the aromatic ring (electrophilic aromatic addition) to give a resonance-stabilized cation intermediate. The second and faster step, loss of H<sup>+</sup> from the cation intermediate, regenerates aromaticity in the ring and gives the product.</p>

<p>The major difference between addition of halogen to an alkene and halogen substitution on an aromatic ring centers on the fate of the cationic intermediate formed in the first step of each reaction. Recall from that <a href="alkenes_electrophilic_add.html">addition of chlorine or bromine to an alkene</a> is a two-step process, the first and slower step of which is formation of a bridged halonium ion intermediate. This cationic intermediate then reacts with chloride or bromide ion to complete the addition. With aromatic compounds, the cationic intermediate instead loses H<sup>+</sup> to regenerate the aromatic ring and regain the large resonance stabilization. No such resonance stabilization is regained in the case of an alkene. The energy diagram in Figure 22.1 shows both addition and substitution reactions of benzene. Addition causes loss of the aromatic resonance energy and is disfavored except under extreme circumstances.</p>
