<h1>Nitriles</h1>

<p><b>Nitriles</b> contain the cyano group, −C≡N, and although they lack the carbonyl group that the othercarboxylic acid derivatives have, they are still classified as <a href="carboxylic_acids_derivatives.html">carboxylic acid derivatives</a> since they are hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids, and also can be produced by dehydration of primary amides.</p>

<p>Inorganic compounds containing the −C≡N group are not called nitriles, but cyanides (it. isocianuri) instead. An <b>isocyanide</b> instead (also called isonitrile or carbylamine) is an organic compound with the functional group -N≡C. It is the isomer of the related nitrile (-C≡N), hence the prefix is isocyano. The organic fragment is connected to the isocyanide group through the nitrogen atom, not via the carbon.</p>

<p>Both the carbon and nitrogen atoms of a nitrile are <i>sp</i> hybridized, and the bond angle is 180°.</p>

<p>IUPAC names follow the pattern alkanenitrile: for example, ethanenitrile. Common names are derived by dropping the suffix -<i>ic</i> or -<i>oic</i> acid from the name of the parent carboxylic acid and adding the suffix -<i>onitrile.</i></p>

<h2>Hydrolysis of a Cyano Group to an Amide in Aqueous Base</h2>

<p>Hydrolysis of a cyano group in aqueous base involves initial formation of the anion of an imidic acid, which, after proton transfer from water, undergoes <a href="keto_enol_tautomerism.html">keto-enol tautomerism</a> to give an amide. The amide is then hydrolyzed by aqueous base, as we have seen earlier, to the carboxylate anion and ammonia.</p>

<p>The acid-catalyzed reaction proceeds similarly; the only difference is in the order of proton transfers.</p>

<p>Hydrolysis of nitriles is a valuable route to the synthesis of carboxylic acids from primary or secondary haloalkanes. In this route, one carbon in the form of a cyano group is added to a carbon chain and then converted to a carboxyl group.</p>

<h2>Reduction</h2>

<p>Lithium aluminum hydride reduces the cyano group of a nitrile to a primary amino group.</p>

CH<sub>3</sub>CH=CH(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>C≡N (6-Octenenitrile) &emsp; 1. LiAlH<sub>4</sub>  ⟶ &emsp; 2. H<sub>2</sub>O &emsp; CH<sub>3</sub>CH = CH(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> 6-Octen-1-amine</p>
</div>

<p>Reduction of cyano groups is useful for the preparation of primary amines only.</p>
