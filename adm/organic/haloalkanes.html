<h1>Haloalkanes</h1>

<p>Compounds containing a halogen atom covalently bonded to an <i>sp</i><sup>3</sup> hybridized carbon atom are named <b>haloalkanes</b>, or, in the common system of nomenclature, <b>alkyl halides</b>. Several haloalkanes are important laboratory and industrial solvents. In addition, haloalkanes are invaluable building blocks for organic synthesis because of the variety of ways in which the halogen may be substituted with other groups or eliminated to produce &pi; bonds. In this chapter, we begin with the structure and physical properties of haloalkanes. We then study radical halogenation of alkanes as a vehicle to introduce an important type of reaction mechanism, namely the mechanism of radical chain reactions. Reactions of oxygen with alkenes and a radical mechanism for HBr addition to alkenes complete the chapter.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>The general symbol for a <b>haloalkane</b> is R−X, where −X may be −F, −Cl, −Br, or −I. If a halogen is bonded to a doubly bonded carbon of an alkene, the compound belongs to a class called <b>haloalkenes</b>. If it is bonded to a benzene ring, the compound belongs to a class called <b>haloarenes</b>, which have the general symbol Ar−X.</p>

<h2>Nomenclature</h2>

<h3>A. IUPAC System</h3>

<p>IUPAC names for haloalkanes are derived by naming the parent alkane according to the rules given in Section 2.3A.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>The parent chain is numbered from the direction that gives the fi rst substituent encountered the lowest number, whether it is a halogen or an alkyl group. If two groups could have the same lowest number from the end of the chain, give the group of lower alphabetical order the lower number. An example is 2-bromo-4-methylpentane.</p>

	</figure>
</li>
	<li><p>Halogen substituents are indicated by the prefixes <i>fluoro-, chloro-, bromo</i>-, and <i>iodo</i>- and are listed in alphabetical order with other substituents.</p></li>

	<li><p>The location of each halogen atom on the parent chain is given by a number preceding the name of the halogen.</p></li>

	<li><p>In haloalkenes, numbering the parent hydrocarbon is determined by the location of the carbon-carbon double bond. Numbering is done in the direction that gives the carbon atoms of the double bond and substituents the lowest set of numbers.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>B. Common Names</h3>

<p>Common names of haloalkanes and haloalkenes consist of the common name of the alkyl group followed by the name of the halide as a separate word. Hence, the name <b>alkyl halide</b> is a common name for this class of compounds. In the following examples, the IUPAC name of the compound is given first, and then its common name is given in parentheses:</p>

<p>Several polyhaloalkanes are important solvents and are generally referred to by their common names. Dichloromethane (methylene chloride) is the most widely used haloalkane solvent. Compounds of the type CHX<sub>3</sub> are called <b>haloforms</b>. The common name for CHCl<sub>3</sub>, for example, is chloroform. The common name methyl chloroform for the compound CH<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub> derives from this name. Methyl chloroform and trichloroethylene (trichlor) were once common solvents for industrial cleaning. Because they are somewhat toxic and cause environmental problems, they have been phased out.</p>

<table class="noborder centertable">
<tr><td>CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub><br>Dichloromethane<br>(Methylene chloride)</td> <td>CHCl<sub>3</sub>Trichloromethane<br> (Chloroform)</td> <td>CH<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub><br>1,1,1-Trichloroethane<br>(Methyl chloroform)</td> <td>CCl<sub>2</sub>=CHCl<br>Trichloroethylene<br> (Trichlor)</td></tr>
</table>

<p id="per">Hydrocarbons in which all hydrogens are replaced by halogens are commonly called perhaloalkanes or perhaloalkenes. Perchloroethylene, commonly known as perc, is a dry cleaning solvent that is also being phased out.</p>
