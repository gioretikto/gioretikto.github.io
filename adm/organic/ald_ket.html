<h1>Aldehyde and Ketones</h1>

<figure>

<figcaption>Ethanol from alcoholic beverages is first metabolized to acetaldehyde before being broken down further in the body. The reactivity of the carbonyl group of acetaldehyde allows it to bind to proteins in the body, the products of which lead to tissue damage and organ disease. Inset: A model of acetaldehyde. </figcaption>

<p>Aldehydes and ketones both contain the <b>carbonyl group</b> − a group in which a carbon atom has  a double bond to oxygen. </p>

<img src="img/Carbonyl_group.png" alt="Carbonyl group"/>

<p>The carbonyl group of an aldehyde is bonded to one hydrogen atom and one carbon atom (excpet for methanal or formaldehyde, which is the the only bearing two hydrogen atoms). The carbonyl grop of a ketone is bonded to two carbon atoms. <br> Following are Lewis structures for formaldehyde, ethanal (which is always called acetaldehyde) and propanone.</p>

</table>

<p>According to valence bond theory, the carbon-oxygen double bond consists of one <i>&sigma;</i> bond formed by the overlap of <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals of carbon and oxygen and
one <i>&pi;</i> bond formed by the overlap of parallel 2<i>p</i> orbitals. The two nonbonding pairs of electrons on oxygen lie in the remaining <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals.</p>

<h2>Nomenclature</h2>

<p>IUPAC names for aldehydes and ketones follow the familiar pattern of selecting as the parent alkane the longest chain of carbon atoms that contains the functional group. We show the aldehyde group by changing the suffix -<i>e</i> of the parent alkane to -<i>al</i> (Section 2.3). Because the carbonyl group of an aldehyde can only appear at the end of a parent chain and because numbering must start with it as carbon-1, its position is unambiguous; there is no need to use a number to locate it. For unsaturated aldehydes, the presence of a carbon-carbon double or triple bond is indicated by the infix -<i>en</i>- or -<i>yn</i>-. As with other molecules with both an infix and a suffix, the location of the group corresponding to the suffix determines the numbering pattern.</p>

<tr><td>3-Methylbutanal</td> <td>2-Propenal<br>(Acrolein)</td> <td>(2E)-3,7-Dimethyl-2,6-octadienal<br>(Geranial)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>For cyclic molecules in which —CHO is bonded directly to the ring, the molecule is named by adding the suffix -<i>carbaldehyde</i> to the name of the ring. The atom of the ring to which the aldehyde group is bonded is numbered 1.</p>

<p>Among the aldehydes for which the IUPAC system retains common names are benzaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde, as well as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. Note here the alternative ways the phenyl group can be written. In benzaldehyde, it is written as a line-angle formula; in cinnamaldehyde, it is written C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>—.</p>

<p>In the IUPAC system, ketones are named by selecting as the parent alkane the longest chain that contains the carbonyl group and then indicating its presence by changing the suffix from -<i>e</i> to -<i>one</i>. The parent chain is numbered from the direction that gives the carbonyl carbon the smaller number. The IUPAC system retains the common names acetone, acetophenone, and benzophenone.</p>

<h2>IUPAC Names for More Complex Aldehydes and Ketones</h2>

<p>In naming compounds that contain more than one functional group that might be indicated by a suffix, the IUPAC system has established an <b>order of precedence of functions</b>. Table 1.0 gives the order of precedence for the functional groups we have studied so far.</p>

<h2>Common Names</h2>

<p>The common name for an aldehyde is derived from the common name of the corresponding carboxylic acid by dropping the word acid and changing the suffix -<i>icor</i> -<i>oic</i> to -<i>aldehyde</i>. Because we have not yet studied common names for carboxylic acids, we are not in a position to discuss common names for aldehydes. We can illustrate how they are derived, however, by reference to a few common names with which you are familiar. The name formaldehyde is derived from formic acid; the name acetaldehyde is derived from acetic acid.</p>

<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>Several ways to prepare aldehydes and ketones have already been described in connection with the chemistry of other functional groups. This section reviews the methods that we have studied, pointing out special features and additional examples. Other routes to aldehydes and ketones will be described in later chapters.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Oxidation of alcohols</p></li>
	<li><p>Ozonolysis of alkenes</p></li>
	<li><p>Hydration of alkynes</p></li>
	<li><p><a href="Friedel.html">Friedel-Crafts acylation</a></p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Oxidation of alcohols</h3>

<p>First, we have seen that <a href="alcohols_oxidation.html">oxidation of alcohols</a> by chromium(VI) reagents gives carbonyl compounds. Secondary alcohols give ketones. Primary alcohols give aldehydes, but only in the absence of water, to prevent overoxidation to carboxylic acids. Overoxidation of aldehydes in the presence of water is due to <a href="ald_ket_hydration.html">hydration to a 1,1-diol</a>. Oxidation of this diol leads to the carboxylic acid.</p>

<img src="img/alcohols_overoxidation.png" alt="alcohols overoxidation"/>

<p>Chromium(VI) is selective and does not oxidize alkene and alkyne units. </p>
