<h1>Crown Ethers</h1>

<p>In the early 1960s, Charles Pedersen of DuPont discovered a family of cyclic polyethers derived from ethylene glycol and substituted ethylene glycols. Compounds of this structure are named crown ethers because one of their most stable conformations resembles the shape of a crown. These ethers are named by the system devised by Pedersen. The parent name crown is preceded by a number describing the size of the ring and followed by a number describing the number of oxygen atoms in the ring, as for example, 18-crown-6.</p>

<p>For his work, Pedersen shared the 1987 Nobel Prize for chemistry with Donald J. Cram of the United States and Jean-Marie Lehn of France. The most significant structural feature of crown ethers is that the diameter of the cavity created by the repeating oxygen atoms of the ring is comparable to the diameter of alkali metal ions. The diameter of the cavity in 18-crown-6, for example, is approximately the diameter of a potassium ion. When a potassium ion is inserted into the cavity of 18-crown-6, the unshared electron pairs on the six oxygens
of the crown ether are close enough to the potassium ion to provide very effective solvation for K<sup>+</sup>:</p>

<p>18-Crown-6 forms somewhat weaker complexes with rubidium ion (a somewhat larger ion) and with sodium ion (a somewhat smaller ion). It does not coordinate to any appreciable degree with lithium ion (a considerably smaller ion). 12-Crown-4, however, with its smaller cavity, does form a strong complex with lithium ion. The cavity of a crown ether is a polar region, and the unshared pairs of electrons on the oxygen atoms lining the cavity provide effective solvation for alkali metal ions. The outer surface of the crown is nonpolar and hydrocarbon-like, and,
thus, crown ethers and their alkali metal ion complexes dissolve readily in nonpolar organic solvents. Crown ethers have proven to be particularly valuable because of their ability
to cause inorganic salts to dissolve in nonpolar aprotic organic solvents such as methylene chloride, hexane, and benzene. Potassium permanganate, for example, does not dissolve in benzene. If 18-crown-6 is added to benzene, the solution takes on the purple color characteristic of permanganate ion. The crown-potassium ion complex is soluble in benzene and brings permanganate ion into solution with it. The resulting “purple benzene” is a valuable reagent for the oxidation of water-insoluble organic compounds. Crown ethers have also proven valuable in nucleophilic displacement reactions. The cations of potassium salts, such as KF, KCN, or KN<sub>3</sub>, are very tightly bound within the solvation cavity of 18-crown-6 molecules. The anions, however, are only weakly solvated, and because of the geometry of cation binding within the cavity of the crown, only loose ion pairing occurs between the anion and cation. Thus, in nonpolar aprotic solvents, these anions are without any appreciable solvent shell and are, therefore, highly reactive as nucleophiles. The nucleophilicity of F<sup>&minus;</sup> , CN <sup>&minus;</sup>, N<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>, and other anions in nonpolar aprotic solvents containing an 18-crown-6 equals and often exceeds their nucleophilicity in polar aprotic solvents such as DMSO and acetonitrile.</p>
