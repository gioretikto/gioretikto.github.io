<h1>Alkynes</h1>

<p>The functional group of an alkyne is a carbon-carbon triple bond. The simplest alkyne is ethyne, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, more commonly named acetylene. Acetylene is a linear molecule; all bond angles are 180°. The carbon-carbon bond length in acetylene is 121 pm (1.21 Å) (Figure 7.1). By comparison, the length of the carbon-carbon double bond in ethylene is 134 pm (1.34 Å), and that of the carbon-carbon single bond in ethane is 153 pm (1.53 Å). Thus, triple bonds are shorter than double bonds, which, in turn, are shorter than single bonds. The bond dissociation enthalpy of the carbon-carbon triple bond
in acetylene [966 kJ (231 kcal)/mol] is considerably larger than that for the carbon-carbon double bond in ethylene [727 kJ (174 kcal)/mol] and the carbon-carbon single bond in ethane [376 kJ (90 kcal)/mol]. The difference in bond dissociation enthalpies between the carbon-carbon triple bond in acetylene and the carbon-carbon double bond in ethylene is only 239 kJ (57 kcal)/mol. This difference indicates that a &pi; bond in an alkyne is weaker than a &pi bond in an alkene. A triple bond is described in terms of the overlap of sp hybrid orbitals of adjacent carbon atoms to form a &sigma; bond, the overlap of parallel 2p y orbitals to form one p bond, and the overlap of parallel 2p<sub>z</sub> orbitals to form a second &pi; bond. In acetylene, each carbon-hydrogen bond is formed by the overlap of a 1<i>s</i> orbital of hydrogen with an <i>sp</i> orbital of carbon. Because of the 50% <i>s</i>-character of the acetylenic C&minus;H bond, it is unusually strong.</p> 

<h2>Nomeclature - IUPAC Names</h2>

<p>According to the rules of the IUPAC system, the infix -<i>yn</i>- is used to show the presence of a carbon-carbon triple bond. Thus, HC≡CH is named ethyne, and CH<sub>3</sub>C≡CH is named propyne. The IUPAC system retains the name acetylene; therefore, there are two acceptable names for HC≡CH, ethyne and acetylene. Of these names, acetylene is used much more frequently. There is no need to use a number to locate the position of the triple bond in ethyne and propyne; there is only one possible location for it in each compound. For larger molecules, number the longest carbon chain that contains the triple bond
from the end that gives the triply bonded carbons the lower numbers. Show the location of the triple bond by the number of its first carbon. If a hydrocarbon chain contains more than one triple bond, we use the infixes -<i>adiyn-, -atriyn</i>-, and so forth.</p>

<h2>Common Names</h2>

<p>Common names for alkynes are derived by prefi xing the names of substituents on the carbon-carbon triple bond to the word acetylene. Note in the third example that, when a carbon-carbon double bond (indicated by -<i>en</i>-) and a carbon-carbon triple bond (indicated by -<i>yn</i>-) are both present in the same molecule, the IUPAC rules specify that the location of the double bond takes precedence in numbering the compound.</p>

<p>Alkynes in which the triple bond is between carbons 1 and 2 are commonly referred to as <b>terminal alkynes</b>. Examples of terminal alkynes are propyne and 1-butyne.</p>

<p>The smallest cycloalkyne that has been isolated is cyclooctyne. This molecule is quite unstable and polymerizes rapidly at room temperature. The C&minus;C≡C bond angle in cyclooctyne is calculated to be approximately 155°, indicating a high degree of angle strain. Cyclononyne has also been prepared and is stable at room temperature. The calculated C&minus;C≡C bond angles in this cycloalkyne are approximately 160°, which still represents a considerable distortion from the optimal 180°. You can see the distortion of the C&minus;C #C bond angles in the accompanying optimized molecular model. You can also see the degree to which C&minus;C and C&minus;H bonds on adjacent carbons are staggered, thus minimizing torsional strain.</p>

<h2>The physical properties of alkynes</h2>

<p>The physical properties of alkynes are similar to those of alkanes and alkenes with analogous carbon skeletons. The lower-molecular-weight alkynes are gases at room temperature. Those that are liquids at room temperature have densities less than 1.0 g/mL (less dense than water). Listed in Table 7.1 are melting points, boiling points, and densities of several low-molecular-weight alkynes. Because alkynes, like
alkanes and alkenes, are nonpolar compounds, they are insoluble in water and other polar solvents. They are soluble in each other and in other nonpolar organic solvents.</p>
