<h1>Disubstituted cyclohexanes</h1>

<p>In monosubstituted cyclohexanes, the steric strain and the resulting preference for the equatorial position over the axial position result from the interaction of the substituent with the axial atoms of
the ring. In disubstituted cyclohexanes, we have to consider both the inherent steric strain for each individual substituent and any interactions that may occur between the substituents.

<h3>cis- and trans-1,4-Dimethylcyclohexanes</h3>

<p>We’ll start with compounds in which the substituents do not interact with one another. This situation occurs in cis- and trans-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane. The two methyl groups in the cis isomer are on the
same side of the ring. We can place both substituents on the “top” of the ring. In the following chair conformation, the “up” position at the C(1) atom is axial; the “up” position at the C-4 atom is equatorial. This conformation can convert to another conformation by a ring flip, which changes the C-1 methyl from axial to equatorial and the C-4 methyl group from equatorial to axial.</p>

<p>This conformational change does not alter the cis relationship of the methyl groups. Moreover, the two conformations are equivalent because each one has an equatorial and an axial methyl group. The
steric energy of the cis isomer is 7.6 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup>, like that of the axial conformation of methylcyclohexane.<br> Because <i>cis</i>-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane has an axial methyl group in both of its chair conformations, and because trans-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane can exist in a conformation in which both methyl groups are equatorial, the trans isomer is more stable than the <i>cis</i> isomer. The two geometric isomers differ in energy by 7.6 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup>. This energy difference is due solely to the axial methyl group of the <i>cis</i> isomer. <br> Now let’s consider <i>trans</i>-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane. The trans isomer has the two methyl groups on the opposite sides of the ring. Let’s place the methyl group at the C-1 atom on the “top” of the ring, which corresponds to an axial position. The methyl group at the C-4 atom must then be placed on the “bottom” of the ring, also an axial position. A diaxial arrangement of methyl groups results in a situation that clearly has considerable steric strain.</p>

<p>The steric strain of the diaxial conformation is twice that of the axial conformation of methyl-cyclohexane or 2 × 7.6 = 15.2 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup>. However, interconversion of this conformation by a ring flip changes both axial methyl groups into equatorial methyl groups. The steric energy of this conformation is zero, like the equatorial conformation of methylcyclohexane. Thus, the diaxial conformation
is 15.2 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup> less stable than the diequatorial conformation. Because of this energy difference, approximately 99.5% of the compound exists in the diequatorial conformation at 25 °C.<br>
Because <i>cis</i>-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane has an axial methyl group in both of its chair conformations, and because trans-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane can exist in a conformation in which both methyl groups are equatorial, the trans isomer is more stable than the cis isomer. The two geometric isomers differ in energy by 7.6 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup>. This energy difference is due solely to the axial methyl group of the
<i>cis</i> isomer.</p>
