<h1>Optical Activity</h1>

<p>The study of chirality originated in the early 19th century during investigations by the French physicist Jean-Baptiste Biot into the nature of <i>plane-polarized light</i>. A beam of ordinary light consists of electromagnetic waves that oscillate in an infinite number of planes at right angles to the direction of light travel. When a beam of ordinary light passes through a device called a <i>polarizer</i>, however, only the light waves oscillating in a single plane pass through and the light is said to be plane-polarized. Light waves in all other planes are blocked out. Biot made the remarkable observation that when a beam of plane-polarized light passes through a solution of certain organic molecules, such as sugar or camphor, the plane of polarization is rotated through an angle, a. Not all organic substances exhibit this property, but those that do are said to be <b>optically active</b>. The angle of rotation can be measured with an instrument called a polarimeter, represented in Figure 5.5. A solution of optically active organic molecules is placed in a sample tube, plane-polarized light is passed through the tube, and rotation of the polarization plane occurs. The light then goes through a second polarizer called the analyzer. By rotating the analyzer until the light passes through it, we can find the new plane of polarization and can tell to what extent rotation has occurred. </p>

<p>In addition to determining the extent of rotation, we can also find the direction. From the vantage point of the observer looking directly at the analyzer, some optically active molecules rotate polarized light to the left (counterclockwise) and are said to be <b>levorotatory</b>, whereas others rotate polarized light to the right (clockwise) and are said to be <b>dextrorotatory</b>. By convention, rotation to the left is given a minus sign (−) and rotation to the right is given a plus sign (+). (−)-Morphine, for example, is levorotatory, and (+)-sucrose is dextrorotatory. The extent of rotation observed in a polarimetry experiment depends on the number of optically active molecules encountered by the light beam. This number, in turn, depends on sample concentration and sample pathlength. If the concentration of sample is doubled, the observed rotation doubles. If the concentration is kept constant but the length of the sample tube is doubled, the observed rotation doubles. It also happens that the angle of rotation depends on the wavelength of the light used. To express optical rotations in a meaningful way so that comparisons can be made, we have to choose standard conditions. The <b>specific rotation</b>, [a]<sub>D</sub>, of a compound is defined as the observed rotation when light of 589.6 nanometer wavelength is used with a sample pathlength <i>l</i> of 1 decimeter (dm; 1 dm = 10 cm) and a sample concentration c of 1 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. (Light of 589.6 nm, the so-called sodium D line, is the yellow light emitted from common sodium street lamps.)</p>

<p>When optical rotation data are expressed in this standard way, the specific rotation, [a]<sub>D</sub>, is a physical constant characteristic of a given optically active compound. For example, (-)-lactic acid has [a]<sub>D</sub> = +3.82, and (2)-lactic acid has [a]<sub>D</sub> = -3.82. That is, the two enantiomers rotate plane-polarized light to exactly the same extent but in opposite directions. Note that the units of specific rotation are [(deg · cm<sup>2</sup>)/g] but that values are usually expressed without the units. Some additional examples are listed in Table 1.0.</p>

<h2>Racemic Mixtures</h2>

<p>An equimolar mixture of two enantiomers is called a <b>racemic mixture</b>, a term derived from the name “racemic acid” (Latin: <i>racemus</i>, a cluster of grapes). Racemic acid is the name originally given to an equimolar mixture of the enantiomers of tartaric acid (Table 3.1). Because a racemic mixture contains equal numbers of dextrorotatory and levorotatory molecules, its specific rotation is zero. Alternatively, we say that a racemic mixture is optically inactive. A racemic mixture is indicated by adding the prefix (&pm;) to the name of the compound [or sometimes the prefix (<i>d,l</i>)].</p>

<h2>Optical Purity (Enantiomeric Excess)</h2>

<p>When dealing with a pair of enantiomers, it is essential to have a means of describing the composition of that mixture and the degree to which one enantiomer is in excess relative to its mirror image. One way of describing the composition of a mixture of enantiomers is by its percent <b>optical purity</b>, a property that can be observed directly. Optical purity is the specifi c rotation of a mixture of enantiomers divided by the specific rotation of the enantiomerically pure substance when they are at the same concentration.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Percent optical purity = [&alpha;]<sub>sample</sub>/[&alpha;]<sub>pure enantiomers</sub> x 100</p>
</div>

<p>An alternative way to describe the composition of a mixture of enantiomers is by its <b>enantiomeric excess (ee)</b>, which is the difference in the number of moles of each enantiomer in a mixture compared to the total number of moles of both. Enantiomeric excess in percent is calculated by taking the difference in the percentage of each enantiomer.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Enantiomeric excess (ee) = %R − %S</p>
</div>

<p>For example, if a mixture consists of 75% of the R enantiomer and 25% of the S enantiomer, then the enantiomeric excess of the R enantiomer is 50%. Enantiomeric excess and optical purity are numerically identical.</p>

<h2>Interazione luce polarizzata - campione chirale</h2>

<p>The E vector of linearly polarized light (also called plane-polarized light has a constant direction and a modulated amplitude.</p>

modulated direction.

<p>Plane polarized light can be considered to be created by two circularly polarized beams of light, one rotating clockwise and one counterclockwise. In other words the linear vector that traces out the plane polarized wave is formed form two circularly polarized waves, one rotating clockwise and one rotating counterclockwise. Taken separately, these circularly polarized beams of light are rotating in a helical fashion, and hence are chiral.</p>

<p>As the plane polarized light passes through a chiral sample, several different kinds of interactions between the light and the material are possible. One is actual absorption of the light, which we explore below when circular dichroism is discussed. However, another is simple refraction. The indices of refraction of the chiral material for the right and left polarized light are expected to be different, which means that the speed of light through the medium is different for the two polarizations, a phenomena called <b>circular birefringence</b>. Therefore, one of the light components will lag behind the other. "Lagging behind" means a slower rate of propagation due to a different refractive index for that form of light. The result is that right- and left-handed twists no longer have the same phase matching to cancel along the original plane, but instead they cancel along a slighlty different plane, rotated away from the original plane.</p>
