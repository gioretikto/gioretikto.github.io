<h1>The antibacterial sulfonamides</h1>

<p>A <b>sulfonamide</b> (also spelled sulphonamide) is a chemical compound containing a sulfu atomo of sulfonyl functional group )(-SO<sub>2</sub>-) attached to one carbon and one nitrogen atom, also considered as derived from a sulfonic acid by replacing a hydroxyl group with an amine group. It is represented as R<sub>1</sub>—SO<sub>2</sub>—NR<sub>2</sub>R<sub>3</sub> (where R<sub>1</sub> is some organic group, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub> may be H or any organic groups. <b>Sulfanilamide</b> (<i>p</i>-aminobenzenesulfonamide, a compound used in the manufacture of azo dyes, was found to inhibit the growth of bacteria, and this discovery led to the development of sulfa drugs (nowdays used for unary tract infections). </p>

<p>The influenza pandemic of 1918-1920 clearly demonstrated the inability of medical science to stand up to disease. More than 20 million people worldwide were killed by flu that attacked not the old and frail, but the young and strong. This was a disease that no magic bullet could cure and no government could stamp out. Chemotherapy research had to be improved and continued.</p>

<p>In 1927, <b>Gerhardt Domagk</b> (1895-1964), was recruited from the University of Münster by the pharmaceuticals division of IG Farbenindustrie, a recently organized industrial conglomerate made up of German companies, including the former Bayer Company, that specialized in dyes (Farben) and other fine chemicals. In this industrial setting Domagk felt at greater liberty to pursue his research and had far better resources at his command than in the university setting. He would spend the rest of his career there. (After World War II, IG Farben was broken up, and the division in which Domagk worked once again became the Bayer Company.)</p>

<p>Domagk was hired to establish a special pharmacology laboratory and to collaborate with two chemists, Fritz Mietzsch and Josef Klarer. They worked together on a research program to test compounds related to synthetic dyes for their effectiveness against disease. Mietzsch had already accomplished his synthesis of Atabrine, a successful substitute for quinine, the natural antimalarial extracted from the bark of cinchona trees. Finding effective substitutes for natural treatments for bacterial diseases was very much on the new team’s agenda due to monopolistic pricing and wartime shortages of natural substances.</p>

<p>He aimed to find a drug capable of destroying microorganisms after oral administration. The internal route is imperative to treat most infectious diseases. The experimental model he used was the streptococci infection of mice. This model allowed the study of the effect of a large number of drugs. Among a large number of candidates, Domagk turned his attention to azo dyes, so-called because the two major parts of the molecule are linked by a double bond between two nitrogen atoms. Some of these dyes attach strongly to protein in fibres or leather, so that they hold fast against fading or cleaning. Domagk reasoned that they might also attach themselves to the protein in bacteria, inhibiting if not killing microorganisms. In Ehrlich's beloved Latin terminology: <i>Corpora non agunt nisi fixata</i> (agents only work when they are bound). </p>

<p>Among the hundreds of chemical compounds prepared by Mietzsch and Klarer for Domagk to test were some related to the azo dyes. They had the characteristic -N=N- coupling of azo dyes, but one of the hydrogens attached to nitrogen had been replaced by a sulfonamide group. <b>Chrysoidine</b>, which was a deep-red dye, had to be grafted to a sulfonylurea derivative (sulfamidochrysoidine) in order to be active. Testing the new dye on laboratory rats and rabbits infected with streptococci bacteria, Domagk found that it was highly antibacterial but not toxic. It was called Streptozan™, but its name soon changed to <b>Prontosil Rubrum<sup>®</sup></b> 4-(2,4-diaminophenyl)-azo-benzenesulfonamide.</p>

<p>It gave birth to the new era of antimicrobial chemotherapy. The first cure occurred in 1932. At least two versions of the same story coexist. [it is still not clear whether it was
administered in an act of desperation, to a 10-month-old boy who was dying of staphylococcal septicaemia; the baby made an unexpectedly rapid recovery. Another account is that Domagk himself used Prontosil™ to treat his own daughter, who was deathly ill from a streptococcal infection following a pin prick.</p>

<p>Domagk did not immediately publish his remarkable results. His landmark paper of February 1935 was edited shortly after having taken a patent on the product and won wide acclaim in Europe.'” Domagk was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1939, but due to the Nazi veto, did not receive his medal until 1947, after World War II. However, although Domagk discovered sulfonamides, he did not discover the way in which they were active.</p>

<h2>Sulfanilamide</h2>

<p>A French research team with Ernest Fourneau (1872-1949), Jacques Trefouel (1897-1977) and Thérése Trefouel (born 1892), Federico Nitti (1905-1947) and Daniel Bovet (1907-1992) at the Pasteur Institute in Paris did the work. <b>Prontosil</b> was inactive on bacilli cultures because it needed the presence of an esterase to split the molecule. They suggested that the azo linkage of Protonsil Rubrum was cleaved in the patient's body to form. The active part was the sulfonamide (amino-4-benzene sulfonamide) itself and not the dye.' i.e it was functioning as a prodrug, undergoing biological reduction of the azo group to release the 4-aminobenzenesulfonamide fragment as the active antibiotic. Since the active part was colorless it was therefore called "Protonsil Album". The approved name given to this nonpatentable compound was sulfanilamide</p>

<p>The term <b>sulfanilamide</b> is used to describe a family of molecules containing the sulfonamide functional group (-S(=O)<sub>2</sub>-NH<sub>2</sub> a sulfonyl group connected to an amine group) attached to an aniline ring in the <i>para</i>-position.</p>

<p>The Sulfanilamide, Sulfamidochrysoidine (Protonsil, Daniel Bovet was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medine in 1957) was the first of a range of synthetic antibacterial drugs known collectively as <b>sulfa drugs</b>.</p>

<p>If Domagk’s bacterial screen for his azoic dyes had been carried out only in test-tubes and petri dishes, the reductive liberation of sulphonamide would not have occurred, giving a negative result. Positive data were gained from mouse tests, where the metabolism of the dyes (e.g. Prontosil) produced sulphanilamide, which overcame the bacterial challenge.</p>

<p>Doctors in Europe in 1936 had excellent results using the new drug to treat childbed fever and meningitis. Tests in the USA in 1936, initially at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and Western Pennsylvania Hospital in Pittsburgh, showed that it was also effective against various streptococci infections and pneumonia. Prontosil® won wide publicity in the USA in 1936 when it was used to treat President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s son, Franklin, Jr., who was severely ill from a streptococcal infection.</p>

<p>More than 5000 sulphur drugs were prepared in the late 1930s and carly 1940s. Among them, sulfapyridine was used against pneumonia (it was used to treat Winston Churchill when he came down with pneumonia in 1943 just before the Casablanca Conference). Sulfathiazole was used against both pneumonia and staphylococci infections; sulfadiazine was used against pneumonococci, streptococci and staphylococci; and sulfaguanadine against dysentery.</p>

<p>These agents are antibacterial because they mimic in size, shape, and polarity the carboxylic acid <b><i>p</i>-aminobenzoic acid</b>, used by bacteria for the synthesis of folic acid, and sulfanilamide acts as a competitive inhibitor of an enzyme involved in folic acid biosynthesis.</p>

<p>Folic acid is vital for both humans and bacteria. Bacteria synthesize this compound, but humans are unable to synthesize it and, consequently, obtain the necessary amounts from the diet, principally from green vegetables and yeast. This allows selectivity of action. Therefore, sulfa drugs are toxic to bacteria because folic acid biosynthesis is inhibited, whereas they produce little or no ill effects in humans. The structural relationships between carboxylic acids and sulfonic acids that we have observed in rationalizing chemical reactivity are now seen to extend to some biological properties. The use of sulfa drugs as antibacterial drugs has diminished over the years as even better agents have been discovered, but in their time they were crucial to medical health. An interesting additional property of many sulfa drugs has been developed further, however. Many sulfonamides display diuretic activity, and sulfonamide diuretics are still a major drug group. Two widely used examples are <b>furosemide</b> and <b>bendroflumethazide</b>. Furosemide (frusemide) is an aromatic sulfonamide that can be seen to be a structural variant on sulfanilamide. Bendroflumethazide (bendrofluazide) also contains an aromatic sulfonamide grouping, but in addition contains a second sulfonamide group as part of a ring system (compare lactams). This drug is a member of the thiazide diuretics, so named because of the ring system containing this cyclic sulfonamide.</p>

<p>Other sulfanilamides include aildenafil (Viagra®, a popular drug fro the treatement of erectile dysfunction), piroxicam (Feldene, a cyclic sulfonamide used to treat arthitis), and acetazolamide (Diamox, a diuretic used in the treatement of glaucoma).</p>
