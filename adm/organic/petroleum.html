<h1>Sources and Importance of Alkanes</h1>

<p>The three major sources of alkanes throughout the world are the fossil fuels, namely natural gas, petroleum, and coal. These fossil fuels account for approximately 85% of the total energy consumed in the United States. Nuclear electric power, hydroelectric power, and renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, make up most of the remaining 15%. In addition, these fossil fuels provide the bulk
of the raw materials for the organic chemicals used worldwide.</p>

<h2>Natural Gas</h2>

<p id="cracking">Natural gas consists of approximately 90%–95% methane; 5%–10% ethane; and a mixture of other relatively low-boiling alkanes. The current widespread use of ethylene as the organic chemical industry’s most important building block is largely the result of the ease with which ethane can be separated from natural gas and cracked into ethylene. The word “pyrolysis” is coined from two Ancient Greek words (πῦρ) meaning fire and lysis (λύσις) meaning separating (or solution), so pyrolysis means separation by fire or heat. The pyrolysis of alkanes, particularly when petroleum is concerned, is known as <i>cracking</i>. <b>Thermal cracking</b> was discovered as early as the 1860s: At high temperatures (500°C) and high pressures  (25 atm), long-chain  hydrocarbons break into smaller pieces, converting higher alkanes into smaller alkanes and alkenes, and thus increases the gasoline yield; it can even be used for the production of "natural" gas. In addition, the alkenes thus formed are perhaps the most important raw material for the large-scale synthesis of aliphatic compounds. </p>

<p>When alkanes are heated to a high temperature, both C–H bonds and C–C bonds rupture. In the absence of oxygen, the resulting radicals can combine to form new higher- or lower-molecular-weight alkanes. Radicals can also remove hydrogen atoms from the carbon atom adjacent to another radical center to give alkenes, a process called <i><b>hydrogen abstraction</b></i>.</p>

<p>Ethane is cracked by heating it in a furnace at 800°C to 900°C for a fraction of a second. The production of ethylene in the United States in billion pounds, making it the number one organic compound produced by the U.S. chemical industry, on a weight basis. The bulk of ethylene produced in this manner is used to create <a href="polymers.html">organic polymers</a>.</p>

<p>Indeed, very complicated mixtures of alkanes and alkenes form in pyrolyses. Under special conditions, however, these transformations can be controlled to obtain a large proportion of hydrocarbons of a defined chain length.</p>

<p>By far, the largest source of hydrocardons is crude oil, which contains mostly alkanes. This process effectively converts more of the crude oil into compounds suitable for use as gasoline. Ethylene, propylene, and butene are synthesized industrially by steam cracking of light (C<sub>2</sub>–C<sub>8</sub>) alkanes.</p>

<p>In a modification called <b>steam cracking</b>, the hydrocarbon is diluted with steam, heated for a fraction of a second to 700-900°, and rapidly cooled. Steam cracking is of growingimportanceinthepro-ductionof hydrocarbons as chemicals, including ethylene, propylene,butadiene, isoprene, and cyclopentadiene. <br> Steam cracking takes place without a catalyst at temperatures up to 900 °C. The process is complex, although it undoubtedly involves radical reactions. The high-temperature reaction conditions cause spontaneous homolytic breaking of C−C and C−H bonds, with resultant formation of smaller fragments radicals, each of which then loses a hydrogen atom to generate two molecules of ethylene.</p>

<img src="img/cracking_butane.png" alt="cracking butane"/>

<p>Steam cracking is an example of a reaction whose energetics are dominated by entropy (&Delta;<i>S</i>°) rather than by enthalpy (&Delta;<i>H</i>°) in the free-energy equation &Delta;<i>G</i>° = &Delta;<i>H</i>° − <i>T</i>&Delta;<i>S</i>°. Although the bond dissociation energy D for a carbon–carbon single bond is relatively high (about 370 kJ/mol) and cracking is endothermic, the large positive entropy change resulting from the fragmentation of one large molecule into several smaller pieces, together with the high temperature, makes the <i>T</i>&Delta;<i>S</i>° term larger than the &Delta;<i>H</i>° term, thereby favoring the cracking reaction.</p>

<h2>Petroleum</h2>

<p>One of the major source of alkanes is crude oil, also known as petroleum. The term petroleum comes from the Latin stems <i>petra</i>, “rock,” and <i>oleum</i>, “oil. <b>Petroleum</b> is a thick, viscous, liquid mixture of thousands of compounds, most of them hydrocarbons, formed from the decomposition of marine plants and animals. Petroleum and petroleum-derived products fuel automobiles, aircraft, and trains. They provide most of the greases and lubricants required for the machinery of our highly industrialized society. Furthermore, petroleum, along with natural gas, provides nearly 90% of the organic raw materials for the synthesis and manufacture of synthetic fibers, plastics, detergents, drugs, dyes, and a multitude of other products.<br> It is the task of the petroleum refining industry to produce usable products with a minimum of waste, from the thousands of different hydrocarbons in the liquid mixture. Petroleum mixture of alkanes ranging in size from one carbon to 30 or 40 carbons. Formed along with the alkanes, and particularly abundant in California petroleum, are <i>cycloalkanes</i>.</p>

<h3>Desalting crude oil</h3>

<p>Crude oil contains water, salts and sulfur that need to be removed before the crude oil can be refined to its useful components. To remove the salt and the water, crude oil undergoes a step known as desalting. In this step the crude oil undergoes an initial dilution with the addition of clean water. The new diluted mixture is then emulsified so that the salty water initially present in the crude oil comes into contact with the clean water. The emulsion then enters the desalter which separates the emulsion into two separate layers, a layer of water and a layer of crude oil. Salt easily dissolves in water and because of this it is also separated along with the water. <br>The water is then sent to the water treatment system and the crude oil progresses to the next stage. The next stage is to desulfur the crude oil, this is important as this should reduce the emission of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) when any fuel created in the fractional distillation is burnt. <br> Desulfurisation requires heating and pressurising the crude oil to specific conditions and then the addition of hydrogen gas. The addition of the hydrogen gas should cause a reaction with  any sulfur present and form hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S). The hydrogen sulfide is then converted into elemental sulfur and hydrogen, the sulfur can be sold on as a by-product whereas the hydrogen can be recycled and used again in the previous step.</p>

<h3>Fractional distillation of crude oil</h3>

<p>The different components of a mixture have <i>different boiling points</i>, and fractional distillation separates the components as a result of this property. Fractional distillation of crude oil results in a sereis of <b>fractions</b>, each consisting of a mixture of hydrocarbons boiling with a given temperature range. The substances within a fraction may be separated by further distillation. The boiling point of a fraction increases with the number of carbon atoms, because of stronger dispersion forces.</p>

<p>The temperature of the distillation is usually maintained below 350 °C since the rate of thermal decomposition (pyrolysis) of petroleum constituents is minimal below this temperature, becoming substantial above this temperature. <br> <i>Residua</i> are black, viscous materials obtained by distillation of crude oil under atmospheric pressure.</p>

<h3>Bitumi</h3>

<p>Il ricorso ai bitumi naturali ha origini antichissime. Grazie all'elevato potere adesivo ed impermeabilizzant, già a partire dal V millennio a.C., erano ampiamente utilizzati dalle società sumera ed egizia per proteggere gli scafi delle navi e come mastici di collegamento nell'edilizia. In tempi più recenti, i materiali bituminosi sono largamente utilizzati per la realizzazione e manutenzione della pavimentazione stradali ed in un'ampia varietà di appliaczioni industriali, prima fra tutte la preparazione di membrane (o guaine) impermeabilizzanti. <br> I bitumi sono materiali derivati comunemente dalla raffinazione del petrolio grezzo (<b>bitumi artificiali</b>) che, a temperatura ambiente, hanno consistenza solida viscoelastica e presentano un comportamento termoplastico e ottime caratteristiche di adesione e impermeabilità. <br> I <b>bitumi naturali</b> possono invece essere rinvenuti in giacimenti naturali sotto forma di ammassi sotterranei o affioranti, oppure come componenti impegnanti di rocce sedimentarie o di formazioni sabbiose. <br> Dal punto di vista chimico-fisico, i bitumi sono miscele complesse di composti organici ad alto peso molecolare con prevalenza di idrocarburi e presenza in piccole quantità di zolfo, azoto e ossigeno. Dotati di caratteristiche di adesione e coesione, questi materiali offrono inoltre capacità di resistre alla maggior parte degli acidi, degli alacali e dei sali. Sono parzialmente solubili in molti solventi organici apolari, quali il benzene e possono essere riciclati. <br> Per prolungata esposizione all'aria e agli agenti atmosferici, il bitume subisce un invecchiamento che causa una perdita di elasticità un un indurimento del materiale stesso. </p>

<p>I bitumi artificiali vengono tradizionalmente ottenuti come prodotto di fondo della torre di distillazione sotto vuoto, che tratta il residuo di fondo della colonna di distillazione atmosferica del petrolio.  <br>Il residuo viene rimosso dal fondo, riscaldato a 400 °C e trattato in una colonna sotto vuoto, dove viene nuovamente frazionato in una parte più leggera (olio combustibile) e in residuo bituminoso finale. Quest'ultimo può essere trattato attraverso processi di ossidazione, che si effettuano per soffiatura con aria a circa 250°C in presenza di catalizzatori, conferendo così al materiale le cartatteristiche necessarie affinché possa trovare impiego nel settore delle impermeabilizzazioni.</p>

<p>The term <i>bitumen</i> (also, on occasion, referred to as <i>native asphalt</i>, and <i>extra heavy oil</i>) includes a wide variety of naturally occurring reddish brown to black materials of semisolid, viscous to brittle character that can exist in nature with no mineral impurity or with mineral matter contents that exceed 50% by weight. Bitumen is frequently found filling pores and crevices of sandstone, limestone, or argillaceous sediments, in which case the organic and associated mineral matrix is known as <i>rock asphalt</i> (Abraham, 1945; Hoiberg, 1964). </p>

<h3>Tar - Catrame</h3>

<p>The terms tar and bitumen are often used to describe the same material due their similarity in appearance and properties. However, there are very significant differences between the two materials. Whereas bitumen is generally refined by the distillation of crude oil, tar is a by-product of the destructive distillation of solid fuel. The residue from this destructive distillation is termed 'pitch' and, when combined with light oils produces refined tar. The temperatures involved in the destructive distillation of solid fuel are very high (700−1200 °C) in comparison to those which are used to produce bitument (~ 350 °C) and consequently a significant degree of cracking occurs. This cracking can lead to the production of significant concentrations of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. </p>

<p>Tar sand bitumen is a high-boiling material with little, if any, material boiling below 350°C (660°F) and the boiling range is close to the boiling range of an atmospheric residuum. <br> It is incorrect to refer to bitumen as <i>tar</i> or <i>pitch</i>. Although the word tar is somewhat descriptive of the black bituminous material, it is best to avoid its use with respect to natural materials. More correctly, the name far is usually applied to the heavy product remaining after the destructive distillation of coal or other organic matter. Pitch is the distillation residue of the various types of tar.</p>

<h3>Asphalt</h3>

<p>The term 'asphalt' if often used as an abbreviation for asphalt concrete. Asphalt is a sticky, black, highly viscous liquid or semisolid that is present in most crude petroleum and in some natural deposits. Asphalt is composed almost entirely of bitumen. Asphalt is sometimes confused with, tar, an artificial material produced by the destructive distillation of organic matter.</p>

<p>In addition to being used directly as just described, certain petroleum fractions are converted into other kinds of chemical compounds. <b>Catalytic isomerization</b> changes straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain ones.</p>

<p>Another source of smaller hydrocarbons is <b>hydro-cracking</b>, carried out in the presence of hydrogen at high pressure and at much lower temperatures (250-450°).</p>

<p id="catalytic">Originally, cracking (also called pyrolysis) required heating the gasoline to very high temperatures in order to obtain hydrocarbons with three to five carbons. Modern <b>catalytic cracking</b> methods use catalysts, such as crystalline sodium aluminosilicates, also called zeolites, to accomplish the same thing at much lower temperatures. For example, zeolite-catalyzed pyrolysis of dodecane yields a mixture in which hydrocarbons containing from three to six carbons predominate.</p>

</table>

<p>In the process of <b>catalytic cracking</b>, the hydrocarbon feedstocks of crude oil are mixed with solid catalyst and heated to temperatures above 500 °C. These conditions allow C−C single bonds to be broken, froming reactive intermediates that eventually react to form smaller alkanes and alkanes.</p>

<p>The smaller hydrocarbons formed in the initial reactions react again to form even smaller hydrocarbons. After several cracking cycles, the major alkene product formed is ethylene, the smallest possible alkene.</p>

<p id="reforming">The process of <b>catalytic reforming</b> converts alkanes and cycloalkanes into aromatic hydrocarbons and thus helps provide the raw material for the large-scale synthesis of another broad class of compounds.

<h2 id="ether">Petroleum ether</h2>

<p>Petroleum ether is the petroleum fraction consisting of C5-C6 aliphatic hydrocarbons and boiling in the range 35–60 °C, and commonly used as a laboratory solvent. Petroleum ether is not classified as an ether; the term is used only figuratively, signifying extreme lightness and volatility. Petroleum ether may include unsaturated hydrocarbons. </p>

<h2 id="ker">Kerosene</h2>

<p>Kerosene is paraffin or paraffin oil or coal oil. It is a flammable, pale yellow or colourless oily liquid with a characteristic not-so-unpleasant odour. Obtained from petroleum, it is used for burning in lamps and domestic heaters or furnaces, as a fuel or fuel component for jet engines and as a solvent for greases and inscecticides. <br> During petroleum refining, kerosene is obtained as the so-called middle distillates of crude oil in the boiling range of about 150-300 °C along with diesel fuel. It can be produced from other crude oil fractions by distillation as straight-run kerosene. It can also be obtained as "cracked kerosene" by cracking heavier portions of the oil at elevated temperatures. Chemically, kerose is amixture of hydrocarbons, the composition of which depends on its source. Usually, it consists of about 10 different hydrocarbons, each of which has 10-16 carbon atoms in the molecule, referred to as naphthenes. Kerosene is less volatile than gasoline, its flash point being 38 °C or higher, whereas as that of gasoline is as low as −40 °C. This makes kerosene a relatively safe-heandling liquid fueld compared to gasoline. Kerosene also has alkylbenzens and naphthalene and its derivatives. Its antiignition temperature is 220 °C. It is immiscible in water but miscible in petroleum solvents. One form of kerosene known as RP-1 is burnt with liquid oxygen as a rocket fuel. <br> Kerosene has been found to be an effective pesticide, effective at killing a large number of insects, notably bed-bugs and head lice. It can also kill mosquito larvae. Kerosene is toxim and harmful. Its us for killing head lice may become a health hazard.</p>

<p>Long chain <i>n</i>-paraffins, (normal-olefins) (C10–C14), derived from straight run kerosene, are the main feedstock component of linear alkylbenzene (LAB), and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), the most common raw material in the manufacture of biodegradable household detergents. <br> Linear alkylbenzene (LAB) is a cost-effective and biodegradable intermediate in the production of detergents and surfactants. Kerosene is the raw material of linear paraffin with high purity, which are finally converted to linear olefins by dehydrogenation. The linear mono-olefins react with benzene in the existence of the catalyst to produce LAB which is used to produce linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), as a biodegradable detergent.</p>

<h2 id="naphtha">Naphtha</h2>

<p>The word naphtha is from Latin and Ancient Greek (νάφθα), derived from Middle Persian naft ("wet", "naphtha"). Naphtha refers to a number of flammable liquid mixture of hydrocarbons. it is a component of natural as condensate or a distillaiton product from petroleum, coal tar or peat boiling in a certain range. It is a broad term and covers the lightest and the most volative fractions of the liquid hydrocarbons in petroleum. Naphtha is a colourless to reddish-brown volatile aromatic liquid very similar to gasoline. <br> In petroleum industry, full range of naphtha is defined as the fraction of hydrocarbons of boiling range between 80 °C and 200 °C, consisting of a complex hydrocarbon mixture of 5-12 carbon atoms. It could be of two types, light naphtha and heavy naphtha. The fraction boiling between 30 °C and 90 °C is called light naphtha and consists of molecules with 5-6 carbon atoms. The fraction boiling between 90 °C and 200 °C is called heavy naphtha and consists of hydrocarbons molecules of 6-12 carbon atoms. The light naphthas have a higher paraffin content and so these are referred to as paraffinic naphtha.</p>
