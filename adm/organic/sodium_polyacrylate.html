<h1>Sodium polyacrylate</h1>

<p>Sodium polyactylate, a dry white powder, is an anionic polyelectrolyte-based polymer comprising of carboxilyc groups that are made of long chains of an ionic unit (called a monomer), sodium acrylate (shown below).</p>

<p>Modern superabsorbent diapers make use of <b>sodium polyacrylate</b> that has a tremendous ability to absorb wate: from 200 to 500 times its weight in water. Inside the surface of the polymer, the high concentration of ions causes water molecules to cross the membrane in the process of osmosis: water rushes in to dilute the sodiium concentration and gets trapped inside. The water then stays put inside the polymer which swells to several times its original size. In fact, the diaper does not even feel wet, thus protecting the baby from nasty rashes. The effect can be reversed by adding salt (sodium chloride) to the gel; this makes the water flow in the opposite direction, converting the gel into a liquid. The maximum swelling of the gel will occur in deionezed water.</p>

<p>The unique property of the diaper polymer is that its surface is semipermeable: upon contact with water sodium ions are hydrated, which reduces their attraction towards the carboxylate ions due to the high dielectric constant of water. This allows the sodium ions to move freely within the network, which contributes to the osmotic pressure within the gel. However, the mobile positive sodium ions cannot leave the gel because they are still weakly attracted to the negative carboxylate ions along the polymer backbone and behave as if they are trapped by a semipermeable membrane.</p>

<p>The polymer cannot dissolve due to its three-dimensional polymeric network structure.</p>

<p>Polyacrylate are even used in the filter that remove water from gasoline.</p>

<p>The degree of cross-linking has a direct effect on the level of swelling of the polymer and the strenght of the network. Increased cross-linking density results in decreased swelling capacity and increased gel strenght.</p>
