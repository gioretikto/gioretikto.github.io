<h1>Infrared spectroscopy</h1>

<p>Becuse typical vibrational frquencies are of the order of 10<sup>13</sup>-10<sup>14</sup> Hz, transitions can be induced with radiation of this frequency, which corresponds to infrared radiation. The <b>infrared (IR)</b> region of the electromagnetic spectrum covers the range from just above the visible wavelengths, &lambda; from (7.8 x 10<sup>−7</sup> m) to approximately 10<sup>−4</sup> m, but the intermediate range from 2.5 x 10<sup>−6</sup> m to 2.5 x 10<sup>−5</sup> m or <b>middle infrared</b>, is most useful to the organic chemist. IR absorption bands are usually described by the reciprocal value, of &lambda; called <b>wavenumber</b> from &nu;̅ = 600 to 4000 cm<sup>−1</sup>, and the energy changes associated with absorption of this radiation range from 1 to 10 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> (4 to 42 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>).</p>

<p>IR spectroscopu has been a useful tool for the determination of the structure of organic molecules for many years. This is because specific types of bonds and/or chemical group have characteristic vibrational frequencies. </p>

<p>A molecule consisting of <i>N</i> atoms can vibrate in 3<i>N</i> − 6 different, independent ways if it is nonlinear and 3<i>N</i> − 5 different ways if it is linear. These, different, independent vibrations are called <b>normal modes</b>. For instance, a CO<sub>2</sub>, molecule has four normal modes of vibrations, two corresponding to stretching the bonds and two corresponding to bending the molecule in two perpendicular planes. Only normal modes that correspond to a changing electric dipole moment can absorb infrared radiation, so only these modes are <b>IR active</b> and contribute to an IR spectrum.</p>

<p><b>Example (Vibrations CO<sub>2</sub>)</b>. CO<sub>2</sub> is a linear molecule and thus has the formula (3<i>N</i>−5). It has 4 modes of vibration (3(3)−5). CO<sub>2</sub> has 2 stretching modes, symmetric and asymmetric. The CO<sub>2</sub> symmetric stretch is not IR active because there is no change in dipole moment because the net dipole moments are in opposite directions and as a result, they cancel each other. In the asymmetric stretch, O atom moves away from the C atom and generates a net change in dipole moments and hence absorbs IR radiation at 2350 cm<sup>−1</sup>. 
The vibrations 3a and 3b are both vibrations that the angle of OCO changes and called <b>bending vibrations</b>. While the vibrations 3a and 3b are independent of each other, energies required for the vibrations are principally equal to each other, only with planes of the vibrations differing 90 degrees from each other; That is the two bending vibrations have exactly the same energy and occur at 666 cm<sup>−1</sup>.</p>

<h2>Technique</h2>

<p>The IR vibrational spectrum of a compound is obtained by exposing the sample to infrared radiation and recording the variation of the absorbance with frequency, wavenumber, or wavelength. In early spectrometers, the transmission was measured as the frequency of the radiation was swept between two limit. Now the spectrum is extracted from an inteferogram by <b>Fourier transfmormation</b>, which converts information in the time domain to the frequency domain. The sample must be contained in a material that does not absorb IR radiatoin, which means that glass cannot be used and aqueous solutions are unsuitable unless the spectral bands of interest occur at frequencies not aborbed by water. Optical windos are typically constructed from CsI. </p>
