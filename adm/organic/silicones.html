<h1>Silicones</h1>

<p>A silicone or polysiloxane is a polymer made up of <i>siloxane</i> (−R<sub>2</sub>Si−O−SiR<sub>2</sub>−, where R = organic group) as repeat unit. If the repat units vary from 500 to 5000 then they fall under the category of elastomers. The most common silicone is polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)</p>

<h2>Physiochemical Properties of PDMS Elastomers</h2>

<p>The low energy barrier fro rotation around the Si−O bonds in the chain backbone and the small size of the CH<sub>3</sub> groups attached to the Si atoms are mainly responsible for the low <i>T<sub>g</sub></i> (~ 125°C) of PDMS. Relaxation of chain segments between the crosslinks is rapic at romm temperature, which give PDMS its elastomeric mechanical properties. Because of the difference in electronegativity between Si (1.8) and O(3.5), the Si−O bond has a high degree of polarity. On the other hand, the organic CH<sub>3</sub> groups attached to the Si atoms shield the chain backbone, limiting intermolecular bonding betwee the chains. The strong Si−O bond (~443 kJ/mol) in the chain backbone, similar to those in inorganic silicate glasses, together with the organic CH<sub>3</sub> side groups make PDMS very stable against hydrolytic attack in aqueous media.</p>

<h2>Applications of PDMS</h2>

<p>The high (oxygen) permeability of PDMS elastomers is partly responsible for their use as gas permeable membranes in artificial respirators and as contact lenses. As it can be esasily fabricated to provide a range of desirable mechanical properties, PDMS is widely used in the creation of micofluidic devices, composed of well-controlles micro-patterned surfaces or channels. <br> PDMS implanst have good stability <i>in vivo</i> and they are biocompatible, although they elicit a mild inflammatory response. Commonly referred to as <b>silicone</b>, PDMS has been widely used as implants for breast reconstruction or enlargment. Silicone breast implants take adbantage of the capacity to convert PDMS into various forms, such as gels and elastomers, e.g. breast implants typically consist of a PDMS elastomer shell that encapsulates a PDMS gel to achieve the desired deformability and shape retention.</p>
