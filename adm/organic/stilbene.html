<h1>Stilbene</h1>

<p>Stilbene may refer to one of the two stereoisomers of 1,2-diphenylethene:<p>

<ul>

    <li><p>(E)-Stilbene (trans isomer)</p></li>
    <li><p>(Z)-Stilbene (cis isomer)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(E)-Stilbene, commonly known as trans-stilbene, is an organic compound represented by the condensed structural formula C6H5CH=CHC6H5. Classified as a diarylethene, it features a central ethylene moiety with one phenyl group substituents on each end of the carbon–carbon double bond. It has an (E) stereochemistry, meaning that the phenyl groups are located on opposite sides of the double bond, the opposite of its geometric isomer, cis-stilbene. Trans-stilbene occurs as a white crystalline solid at room temperature and is highly soluble in organic solvents. It can be converted to cis-stilbene photochemically, and further reacted to produce phenanthrene.</p>

<p>Stilbene was discovered in 1843 by the French chemist Auguste Laurent. The name "stilbene" is derived from the Greek word στίλβω (stilbo), which means "I shine", on account of the lustrous appearance of the compound.</p>

<h2>Stilbenoids</h2>

<p>Stilbenoids are hydroxylated derivatives of stilbene and have a C6–C2–C6 structure. The stilbenoids are naturally occurring stilbene derivatives. Examples include resveratrol and its cousin, pterostilbene</p>

<h3>Resveratrol</h3>

<p>Resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a stilbenoid, found as constituent of grapes and wine, as well as other foor products, with antioxidant, anti-infammatory, anti-platelet, and cancer preventive properties. Copled with the cardiovascular benefits of modorate amounts of alcohol, and the beneficial antioxidant effects of flavonoids, red wine has now emerged as an unlikely but most acceptable medicinal agent.</p>
