<h1>The Penicillins and Cephalosporins: &beta;-Lactam Antibiotics</h1>

<p>The penicillins were discovered in 1928 by the Scottish bacteriologist Sir Alexander Fleming. As a result of the brilliant experimental work of Sir Howard Florey, an Australian pathologist, and Ernst Chain, a German chemist who fl ed Nazi Germany, penicillin G was introduced into the practice of medicine in 1943. For their pioneering work in developing one of the most effective antibiotics of all time, Fleming, Florey, and Chain were awarded the 1945 Nobel Prize in medicine or physiology. <br>The mold from which Fleming discovered penicillin was <i>Penicillium notatum</i>, a strain that gives a relatively low yield of penicillin. It was replaced in commercial production of the antibiotic by <i>P. chrysogenum</i>, a strain cultured from a mold found growing on a grapefruit in a market in Peoria, Illinois. <br>The structural feature common to all penicillins is a &beta;-lactam ring fused to a five-membered thiazolidine ring.</p>

<p>The penicillins owe their antibacterial activity to a common mechanism that inhibits the biosynthesis of a vital part of bacterial cell walls. </p>

<p>Soon after the penicillins were introduced into medical practice, penicillin-resistant strains of bacteria began to appear and have since proliferated. One approach to combating resistant strains is to synthesize newer, more effective penicillins. Among those developed are ampicillin, methicillin, and amoxicillin. Another approach is to search for newer, more effective &beta;-lactam antibiotics. At the present time, the most effective of these are the cephalosporins, the first of which was isolated from the fungus <i>Cephalosporium acremonium</i>.</p>

<p>The cephalosporin antibiotics have an even broader spectrum of antibacterial activity than the penicillins and are effective against many penicillin-resistant bacterial strains. However, resistance to the cephalosporins is now also widespread.<br> A common mechanism of resistance in bacteria involves their production of a specific enzyme, called &alpha; &beta;-lactamase, that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the &beta;-lactam ring, which is common to all penicillins and cephalosporins. Several compounds have been found that inhibit this enzyme, and now drugs based on these compounds can be taken in combination with penicillins and cephalosporins to restore their effectiveness when resistance is known to be a problem. The commonly prescribed formulation called Augmentin is a combination of a b-lactamase inhibitor and a penicillin. It is used as a second line of defense against childhood ear infections when resistance is suspected. Most children know it as the white liquid with a banana taste.</p>
