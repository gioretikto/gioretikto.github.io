<h1>The Opioids</h1>

<p>Morphine and similar molecules, like heroin and codeine (structures shown), are members of a drug family called <i>opioids</i>. Molecules in the opioid family bind to opioid receptors in the
nervous system and block the transmission of pain signals to the brain. As a result, they are potent analgesics (pain relievers). In addition, opioids are known to act as depressants (causing sedation and slower respiratory function), and they also relieve symptoms of anxiety and cause an overall state of euphoria. Morphine is addictive, so it is primarily used for the short-term treatment of acute pain and for terminally ill patients suffering from extreme pain. The analgesic properties of morphine have been exploited for over a millennium. It is the major component of opium, obtained from the unripe seed pods of the poppy plant, <i>Papaver somniferum</i>. Morphine was first isolated from opium in 1803, and by the mid-1800s, it was used heavily to control pain during and after surgical procedures. By the end
of the 1800s, the addictive properties of morphine became apparent, which fueled the search for nonaddictive analgesics. In 1925, the structure of morphine was correctly determined. This structure functioned as a lead compound and was modified to produce other compounds with analgesic properties. Early modifications focused on replacing the hydroxyl (OH) groups with other functional groups. Examples include heroin and codeine:</p>

<p>Heroin exhibits stronger activity than morphine and is extremely addictive. Codeine shows less activity than morphine and is less addictive. Codeine is currently used as an analgesic
and cough suppressant. <br> In 1938, the analgesic properties of meperidine, also known as Demerol, were fortuitously discovered. As the story goes, meperidine was originally prepared to function as an antispasmodic agent (to suppress muscle spasms). When administered to mice, it curiously caused the tails of the mice to become erect. It was already known that morphine and related compounds produced a
similar effect in mice, so meperidine was further tested and found to exhibit analgesic properties. This discovery generated much interest by providing new insights in the search for other analgesics.
By comparing the structures of morphine, meperidine, and their derivatives, scientists were able to determine which structural features are essential for analgesic activity, shown in red:</p>

<h2>Morphine</h2>

<p>Morphine is a pain medication of the opiate family which is found naturally in a number of plants and animals, including humans. It acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to decrease the feeling of pain. It can be taken for both acute pain and chronic pain. It is frequently used for pain from myocardial infarction and during labor. It can be given by mouth, by injection into a muscle, by injection under the skin, intravenously, injection into the space around the spinal cord, or rectally. Maximum effect is reached after about 20 minutes when given intravenously and after 60 minutes when given by mouth, while duration of effect is 3–7 hours. Long-acting formulations also exist.</p>

<p>After the invention of the hypodermic syringe in the 1850s, a new method of administring directly into the bloodstream was more effective in relieving pain, but it also greatly increased the number of morphine addicts.</p>

<h2>3,6-diacetylmorphine (Heroin)</h2>

<p>Like aspirin, heroin was first developed by chemist at Bayer, in 1874 when an English chemist added two acetyl groups to the morphine molecule by reaction with acetic anhydride, thus the name diacetylmorphine and was first intorduced in 1898. The reaction of acetic anhydride and morphine which produces heroin, produces acetic acid as a by-product. Acetic acid is the major organic component of vinegar. For this reason, drug-sniffing dogs are trained to recognize the vinegar-like odor that may still be present in clandestine shipments of poorly purified heroin.</p>

<p>Because heroin is very soluble in water, it's easy for an addict to prepare for intravenous injection. The addict adds a small amount of the white heroin powder to a teaspoon containing water and then heats the spoon with a match. <br>Quinine is the material most commonly used to cut (dilute) heroin, although starch, lactose and mannitol have also been used for this purpose. Quinine, like heroin, has a bitter taste and is used by drug dealers to mask the potency of the heroin. A "bag" contains about 100 mg of powder, only a small portion of which is actually heroin; the rest is filler. In the period 1960 to 1980, the average bag of heroin contained 15% to 20% heroin; today, a bag may contain as much as 35% heroin. </p>

<p>In the body, heroin is biotransformed into morphine, a process that gives heroin its analgesis potential. But because of differences in its chemical structure, heroin is much more lipid soluble than morphine. The difference in chemical structure allows heroin to cross the <a href="../biologia/barrieta_ematoencefalica.html">blood-brain barrier</a> 100 times faster that morphine, a characterstic that makes it especially attractive as a drug of abuse.  <b>The two acetyl groups reduce the polarity of the agent.</b></p>

<h2>Methadone</h2>

<p>Methadone is a synthetic narcotic that has been widely used to treat heroin addiction, albeit with limited success. Like heroin, methadone is highly addictive, but when taken orally it does no induce the stupor that is characteristic of heroin intoxication. Methadone is available for free in clinics. If an addict who is taking methadone decides to inject heroin, the methadone in his system blocks the euphoric rush normally produced by heroin. The loss of the euphoric high reduces the addict's desire to use heroin again. Unlike a heroin addict, a person on methadone maintenance is usually able to hold a job. </p>

<p>Ingestion of coniine, isolated from water hemlock, can cause weakness, labored respiration, paralysis, and eventually death. Coniine is the toxic substance in the “poison hemlock” used in the death of Socrates. In small doses, nicotine is an addictive stimulant. In larger doses, it causes depression, nausea, and vomiting. In still larger doses, it is a deadly poison. Solutions of nicotine in water are used as insecticides. Cocaine is a central nervous system stimulant obtained from the leaves of the coca plant.</p>

<h3>Morphine discovery</h3>

<p>In about 1805, Friedrich Wilhelm Serturner, a German pharmacist, was the first to isolate and identify the organic alkaloid compound, morphine, from the gum resin excreted from the opium poppy.
Serturner used hot water to extract the opium and then used ammonia to precipitate out the bitter crystalline morphine. This rescarch set the stage for the identification of other alkaloids, such as strychnine in 1818, caffeine in 1821, and nicotine in 1828. Serturner named his new substance morphium after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus. By the 1820s, morphine was available from pharmaceutical companies and other sources across Western Europe. By the 1850s, the development of hypodermic syringes with hollow pointed needles by Francis Rynd and Charles Pravaz permitted the widespread administration of morphine. Morphine was initially used as a cure for opium addiction, as well as for its analgesic and antitussive effects. Like many other drugs, morphine became hailed as a panacea soon after its introduction. The regular use of morphine by soldiers during and after the U.S. Civil War, as well as the subsequent Franco-Prussian War in Europe, led to morphine addiction being known as the so/dier’s dis-
ease. During the 19th century, morphine was commonly used in remedies for assorted conditions, including headaches, diarrhea, menstrual pains, and colic. Morphine was thought to be a useful cure for
alcoholism, even though it was known to be addictive. Physicians and others considered alcoholism to be worse than morphine addiction. It was regularly included in an array of patent medicines and could
also be ordered by mail. Growing public concern with this accessibility led to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906 and then to the Harrison Narcotic Act in 1914. An unintended effect of the
Harrison Narcotic Act was the closure of the few drug treatment programs then available. Ironically, heroin was introduced to treat morphine addiction. Heroin is metabolized into morphine by the removal
of the acetyl groups.<br> Morphine is a highly effective painkiller. It is commonly prescribed for the relief of severe pain, such as that associated with surgery or cancer. Side effects of morphine include nausea, vomiting, constipation, blurred vision, lethargy, and respiratory suppression. The effects of morphine are generally potentiated by alkaline substance and antagonized by acidic substances. The analgesic effects are potentiated by melatonin, methocarbamol, and chlorpromazine. <br> Morphine is a highly addictive substance, with tolerance and dependence developing rapidly. The direct analgesic effect of morphine appears to become attenuated over the history of use. Successive administration of the drug appears to elicit a compensatory learned hyperalgesic response leading to tolerance. This process seems to be a combination of the conditioned association to the rituals accompanying use as well as to the systemic effects of the substance. Overdose is possible, resulting in depressed respiration, constriction of the pupils, cold and clammy skin, stupor or coma, sometimes accompanied by drop in a blood pressure and slowed heart rate. The effects of morphine can be countered by the use of opioid antagonists, such as naltrexone or naloxone. Methadone and buprenorphine have been used to treat morphine addiction. Clonidine (Catapres) can be uscd for relief of withdrawal symptoms. Rapid detoxification has been attempted
through joint administration of clonidine and naloxone. Levo-alpha acetyl mehadol (i.e., LAAM) and naltrexone, a longer acting opioid antagonist, can be given to prevent relapse. The half-life of morphine is
between 1.5 and 4.5 hours. Morphine is eliminated primarily through renal excretion. Physical dependence to morphine results in moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms in those who suddenly stop using the drug. Signs of withdrawal can include restlessness, drippy nose, teary eyes, sweating, yawning, gooseflesh, and sleep disturbance during the first 24 hours, with other symptoms becoming more severe over the next 72 hours including extreme irritability; anxiety; nausea; spasms and twitching of muscles; abdominal, leg, and back pains; hot and cold flashes; diarrhea; vomiting; and insomnia. Although extremely uncomfortable, the symptoms of withdrawal are not physically dangerous in otherwise healthy individuals. However, it is important to maintain appropriate fluid and electrolyte balance during the abstinence syndrome. Withdrawal treatment is primarily supportive and concerned with symptom relief. Morphine sulfate is marketed under names such as MS-Contin, Infumorph, Roxanol, Duramorph, Oramorph, and MSIR. </p>
