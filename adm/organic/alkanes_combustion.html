<h1>Reactions of alkanes</h1>

<p>Alkanes and cycloalkanes are quite unreactive toward most reagents, a behavior consistent with the fact that they are nonpolar compounds and contain only strong sigma bonds. Under certain conditions, however, alkanes and cycloalkanes do react with O<sub>2</sub> and with the halogens Cl<sub>2</sub> and Br<sub>2</sub>. We'll discuss <a href="alkanes_halogenation.html">halogenation</a>, next on.</p>

<h2>Oxidation</h2>

<p>The oxidation of alkanes by O<sub>2</sub> to give carbon dioxide and water is by far their most economically important reaction. Oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons is the basis for their use as energy sources for heat [natural gas, liquefi ed petroleum gas (LPG), and fuel oil] and power (gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel). Following are balanced equations for the complete oxidation of methane (the major component of natural gas) and propane (the major component of LPG).</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>CH<sub>4</sub> + 2O<sub>2</sub> ⟶ CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O &emsp; &Delta;H° = −890.4 kJ (−212.8 kcal)/mol<br>
CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> + 5O<sub>2</sub> ⟶ 3CO<sub>2</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O &emsp; &Delta;H° = −2220 kJ (2−530.6 kcal)/mol</p>
</div>

<p>In this and all other hydrocarbon oxidations, the energy of the products is less than that of the reactants, with the difference in energy being given off as the <b>heat of combustion</b>. The heat of combustion is the energy of the products minus that of the reactants, and for the combustion of methane, for example, it is (−890.4 − 0) = −890.4 kJ (2212.8 kcal)/mol.</p>

<h2>Heats of Combustion and Relative Stability of Alkanes and Cycloalkanes</h2>

<p>One important use of heats of combustion is to give us information about the relative stabilities of isomeric hydrocarbons. To illustrate, consider the heats of combustion of the four constitutional isomers given in Table 1. All four compounds undergo combustion according to this equation.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> + 25/2 O<sub>2</sub> ⟶ 8CO<sub>2</sub> + 9H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
</div>

<p>We see that octane has the largest (most negative) heat of combustion. As branching increases, the &Delta;<i>H</i>° decreases (becomes less negative). Of these four isomers, the isomer with four methyl branches has the lowest (least negative) heat of combustion. Therefore, we conclude that <b>branching increases the stability</b> of an alkane.<br> The data in Table 1. shows that all four compounds give the same products on oxidation, the only differences among them are their relative energies.</p>

<p>As we saw in Section 2.5B, there is considerable strain in small-ring cycloalkanes. We can measure this strain by measuring the heat of combustion versus the ring size. It has been determined by measurement of the heats of combustion of a series of unbranched alkanes that the average heat of combustion per methylene (CH<sub>2</sub>) group is 658.7 kJ (157.4 kcal)/mol. Using this value, we can calculate a predicted heat of combustion for each cycloalkane. Strain energy is the difference between the predicted and actual heats of combustion. <br> Cyclopropane has the largest strain energy of any cycloalkane, which is consistent with the extreme compression of its C−C−C bond angles from 109.5° to 60°. Cyclobutane and cyclopentane each have less strain, and cyclohexane, as expected, has zero strain. What is perhaps surprising is the presence of strain in rings of from 7 to 13 carbon atoms. This strain is primarily the result of torsional and steric strain caused by the fact that these rings are constrained to conformations that cannot achieve ideal bond and torsional angles.<br> The large amount of strain suffered by the small cycloalkanes means that these structures are unstable relative to the larger cycloalkanes, such as cyclohexane. During the combustion process, all the strain is released because stable entities (CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O) are formed. The strain in cyclopropane relative to cyclohexane is released as more heat (per carbon) during burning. In other words, cyclopropane burns hotter because considerable energy is stored in its unstable structure.<p>
