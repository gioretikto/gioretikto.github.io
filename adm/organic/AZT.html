<h1>AZT</h1>

<p>Perhaps the best known of the new viral antimetabolites is zidovudine (azidothymidine, AZT), an analog of deoxythymidine in which the 39-OH has been replaced by an azido group, N<sub>3</sub>. AZT is effective against HIV-1, a retrovirus that is the causative agent of AIDS. It is converted in vivo by cellular enzymes to the 5'-triphosphate, recognized as deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate by viral RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase), and added to a growing DNA chain. There it stops chain elongation because no 3'-OH exists on which to add the next deoxynucleotide. AZT owes its effectiveness to the fact that it binds more strongly to viral reverse transcriptase than it does to human DNA polymerase.</p>
