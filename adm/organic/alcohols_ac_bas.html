<h1>Acidity and Basicity of Alcohols</h1>

<p>Alcohols can function as both weak acids (proton donors) and weak bases (proton acceptors). Table 10.2 lists the acid ionization constants for several low-molecular-weight alcohols. In dilute aqueous solution, only methanol (pK<sub>a</sub> 15.5) is more acidic than water.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>CH<sub>3</sub>O&minus;H + H<sub>2</sub>O ⇌ CH<sub>3</sub>O<sup>&minus;</sup> + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup></p>
<p><i>K<sub>a</sub></i> = [CH<sub>3</sub>O<sup>&minus;</sup>] [H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>]/[CH<sub>3</sub>OH] = 10<sup>&minus;15.5</sup>, &emsp; p<i>K<sub>a</sub></i> = 15.5</p>
</div>

<p>Ethanol has about the same acidity as water. Higher-molecular-weight, water-soluble alcohols are slightly weaker acids than water. Thus, although alcohols have some acidity, they are not strong enough acids to react with weak bases such as sodium bicarbonate or sodium carbonate. For simple alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol, acidity <b>depends primarily on the degree of solvation and stabilization of the alkoxide ion</b> by water molecules. The negatively charged oxygen atoms of the methoxide and ethoxide ions are almost as accessible for solvation as the hydroxide ion is; therefore, these alcohols are about as acidic as water. As the bulk of the alkyl group bonded to oxygen increases, the ability of water molecules to solvate the alkoxide ion decreases. 2-Methyl-2-propanol (tert-butyl alcohol) is a weaker acid than either methanol or ethanol, primarily because of the bulk of the tert-butyl group, which reduces solvation of the tert-butoxide anion by surrounding water molecules.</p>

<p>In the presence of strong acids, the oxygen atom of an alcohol is a base and reacts with an acid by proton transfer to form an oxonium ion.</p>

<p>To summarize, when trying to predict the mechanisms of reactions involving an hydroxy group, you need to keep in mind that it is both a weak acid and a weak base, so consider adding a proton or taking a proton away in the initial steps of mechanisms when there is a strong acid or base present, respectively. In addition, an important mechanistic theme in many of the reactions of alcohols is that the &minus;OH group, a poor leaving group, reacts with protons or a variety of strong electrophiles to create &minus;OH<sub>2</sub> or analogous group, a much better leaving group, enabling subsequent substitution or elimination reactions to take place.</p>

<p>Inductive effects are also important in determining alcohol acidities. Electron-withdrawing halogen substituents, for instance, stabilize an alkoxide ion by spreading out the charge over a larger volume, thus making the alcohol more acidic. Compare, for example, the acidities of ethanol (pK<sub>a</sub> = 16.00) and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (pK<sub>a</sub> = 12.43), or of tert-butyl alcohol (pK<sub>a</sub> = 18.0) and nonafluoro-tert-butyl alcohol (pK<sub>a</sub> = 5.4).</p>

<h2>Reaction of Alcohols with Active Metals</h2>

<p>Because alcohols are weak acids, they don’t react with weak bases, such as amines or bicarbonate ion, and they react to only a limited extent with metal hydroxides, such as NaOH. Alcohols do, however, react with alkali metals and with strong bases such as sodium hydride (NaH), sodium amide (NaNH<sub>2</sub>), and Grignard reagents (RMgX). Alkoxides are themselves bases that are frequently used as reagents in organic chemistry. To name a metal alkoxide, name the cation first, followed by the name of the anion. The name of the anion is derived from the prefix showing the number of carbon atoms and their arrangement (<i>meth-, eth-, isoprop-, tert-but-</i>, and so on) followed by the suffix -<i>oxide</i>.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>2 CH<sub>3</sub>OH + 2 Na ⟶ 2CH<sub>3</sub>O<sup>&minus;</sup> Na<sup>+</sup> (Sodium methoxide) + H<sub>2</sub><br>
CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH Ethanol + NaNH<sub>2</sub> &emsp;⟶ &emsp;CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O<sup>–</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> (Sodium ethoxide) + NH<sub>3</sub></p>
</div>

<p>Alkoxide ions are nearly the same or somewhat stronger bases than the hydroxide ion. In addition to sodium methoxide, the following metal salts of alcohols are commonly used in organic reactions requiring a strong base in a nonaqueous solvent, as for example sodium ethoxide (EtO<sup>&minus;</sup>Na<sup>+</sup>) in ethanol and potassium tert-butoxide (<i>t</i>-BuO<sup>&minus;</sup>K<sup>+</sup>) in 2-methyl-2-propanol (tert-butyl alcohol).</p>
