<h1>Phospholipids</h1>

<p><b>Phospholipids</b>, or phosphoacylglycerols (known also as Glycerophospholipids) as they are more properly named, are the second most abundant group of naturally occurring lipids. They are found almost exclusively in plant and animal membranes, which typically consist of about 40–50% phospholipids and 50–60% proteins. The most abundant phospholipids are derived from a phosphatidic acid (Figure 26.11). The fatty acids most common in phosphatidic acids are palmitic and stearic acids (both fully saturated) and oleic acid (one double bond in the hydrocarbon chain). Further esterifi cation of a phosphatidic acid with a low-molecular-weight alcohol gives a phospholipid. Several of the most common alcohols forming phospholipids are given in Table 26.4. All functional groups in this table and in Figure 26.11 are

<p>Phospholipids are polar, ionic compounds composed of an alcohol that is attached by a phosphodiester bond to either diacylglycerol or sphingosine.

<p>More than half of the total lipids in most biological membranes are phospholipids. They self-assemble into bilayers, i.e. the polar portion tends to extend towards the membrane exterior and the nonpolar portion is buries in interior. The acyl group at C1 is usually saturated and the one at C2 is usually unsaturated. The compounds are chiral and have an <i>L</i>, or <i>R</i>, configuration at C2.</p></p>

<h3>Snake Venom</h3>

<p>The venom of some poisonous snakes contains a phospholipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes an ester group of a phosphoglyceride. For example, both the eastern diamond back rattlesnake and the Indian cobra 
contain a phospholipase that hydrolyzes an ester bond of cephalins, which causes the membranes of red blood cells to rupture.</p>

<h2 id="bilayers">Lipid Bilayers</h2>

<p>When placed in aqueous solution, phospholipids spontaneously form a lipid bilayer (Figure 1) in which polar head groups lie on the surface, giving the bilayer an ionic coating. Nonpolar hydrocarbon chains of fatty acids lie buried within the bilayer. This self-assembly of phospholipids into a bilayer is a spontaneous process, driven by two types of noncovalent forces: (1) hydrophobic effects, which result when nonpolar hydrocarbon chains cluster together and exclude water molecules, and (2) electrostatic interactions, which result when polar head groups interact with water and other polar molecules in the aqueous environment. Recall from Section 26.2B that formation of soap micelles is driven by these same noncovalent forces; the polar (hydrophilic) carboxylate groups of soap molecules lie on the surface of the micelle and associate with water molecules, and the nonpolar (hydrophobic) hydrocarbon chains cluster within the micelle and thus are removed from contact with water.<br> The arrangement of hydrocarbon chains in the interior of a phospholipid bilayer varies from rigid to fluid, depending on the degree of unsaturation of the hydrocarbon chains themselves. Saturated hydrocarbon chains tend to lie parallel and closely packed, increasing the rigidity of the bilayer. Unsaturated hydrocarbon chains, on the other hand, have one or more cis double bonds, which cause “kinks” in the chains. As a result, they do not pack as closely and with as great an order as saturated chains. The disordered packing of unsaturated hydrocarbon chains leads to increased fluidity of the bilayer. <br> Biological membranes are made of lipid bilayers. The most satisfactory current model for the arrangement of phospholipids, proteins, and cholesterol in plant and animal membranes is the <b>fluid-mosaic model</b> proposed in 1972 by S. J. Singer and G. Nicolson (Figure 1). The term “mosaic” signifies that the various components in the membrane coexist side by side, as discrete units, rather than combining to form new molecules or ions. “Fluid” signifies that the same sort of fluidity exists in membranes that we have already seen for lipid bilayers. Furthermore, the protein components of membranes “float” in the bilayer and can move laterally along the plane of the membrane.</p>

<p>Phospholipids are further divided into two subgroups, depending on the type of alcohol present:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><b>Glycerophospholipids</b> (phosphoglycerides): glycerol-based phospholipids.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Sphingophospholipids</b> (sphingomyelings): sphingosine-based phospholipids (sphingosine a C-18 amino alcohol).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sphingophospholipids">Sphingolipids</h2>

<p><b>Sphingolipids</b> (or brain lipids) are another kind of phospholipids that are esters of an 18-carbon alcohol called sphingosine. They are similar to phospholipids, but the glycerol backbone (in phospholipids) is replaced by <b>sphingosine</b>. They are essential to the structure of cell membranes and are abundant in brain tissues and nerve cell membranes. Sphingolipids include the sphingomyelins and cerebrosides that are based on the molecule sphingosine. As the name suggests, these lipids are affiliated with the myelin sheath surrounding the cells of the neurons. Sphingomyelins comprise about 25% of the lipids in the myelin sheath, and their key role is to transmit electric signals. Cerebrosides are not phospholipids, but contain sphingosine.</p>
