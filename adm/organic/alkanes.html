<h1>Alkanes</h1>

<p>Alkanes, as a class, are characterized by a general inertness to many chemical reagents. All alkanes fit the general molecular formula C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i> +2</sub>, where <i>n</i> is the number of carbon atoms. Alkanes with carbon chains that are unbranched are called <b>normal alkanes</b> or <i>n</i>-alkanes.  Alkanes are <b>saturated hydrocarbons</b>; that is, they contain only
carbon-carbon single bonds. In this context, saturated means that each carbon has the maximum number of hydrogens bonded to it. Alkanes are often referred to as <b>aliphatic hydrocarbons</b> because
the physical properties of the higher members of this class resemble those of the long carbon-chain molecules found in animal fats and plant oils (Greek: ἄλειφαρ, fat or oil). <br> Carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds are quite strong; they do not break unless alkanes are heated to very high temperatures. Because carbon and hydrogen atoms have nearly the same electronegativity, the carbon—hydrogen bonds of alkanes are only slightly polarized.  As a consequence, they are generally unaffected by most bases. Molecules of alkanes have no unshared electrons to offer as sites for attack by acids. This low reactivity of alkanes toward many reagents accounts for the fact that alkanes were originally called <b>paraffins</b> (<i>parum affinis</i>, Latin: "little affinity" for other compounds). <br> The term paraffin, however, was probably not an appropriate one. We all know that alkanes react vigorously with oxygen when an appropriate mixture is ignited. This combustion occurs, for example, in the cylinders of automobiles, in furnaces, and, more gently, with paraffin candles. When heated, alkanes also react with chlorine and bromine, and they react explosively with fluorine.</p>

<h3 id="alkyl">Alkyl groups</h3>

<p>A group derived from an alkane by removal of one of its hydrogen atoms is known as an <b>alkyl group</b>. We name alkyl groups by dropping the -<i>ane</i> from the name of the parent alkane and adding
the suffix -<i>yl</i>. For example, the methyl group (CH<sub>3</sub>─) from methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and the ethyl group (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>─) from ethane (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>) and so on. A −CH<sub>2</sub>− group is called a <b>methylene group</b>, the suffix -<i>ene</i> is common to all doubly hydrogen-deficient carbon atoms.</p>

<h2>Boiling Points</h2>

<p>The boiling points of alkanes are lower than those of almost any other type of compound of the same molecular weight. In general, both boiling and melting points of alkanes increase with increasing molecular weight (Table 2.5). Alkanes containing 1 to 4 carbons are gases at room temperature, and those containing 5 to 17 carbons are colorless liquids. High-molecular-weight alkanes (those with 18 or more carbons) are white, waxy solids. Several plant waxes are high-molecular-weight alkanes. The wax found in apple skins, for example, is an unbranched alkane with molecular formula C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>56</sub>. Paraffin wax, a mixture of high-molecular-weight alkanes, is used for wax candles, in lubricants, and to seal home-canned jams, jellies, and other preserves. Petrolatum, so named because it is derived from petroleum refi ning, is a liquid mixture of high-molecular-weight alkanes. Sold as mineral oil and Vaseline, petrolatum is used as an ointment base in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics and as a lubricant and rust preventative.</p>

<p>Alkanes occur in nature in deposits of natural gas and oil. Il metano è il componente principale del gas naturale, seguono quantità più piccole di etano, propano, e butano. Petroleum is a complex mixture of alkanes and other hydrocarbons. Petroleum is refined by distillation.</p>

<p>The most important use of alkanes is as fuels for combustion processes to produce heat and power:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub> + (3n+1)/2 O<sub>2</sub> → n CO<sub>2</sub> + (n + 1) H<sub>2</sub>O + heat</p>
</div>

<p>In the chemical laboratory the major use of alkanes is as solvents. Their property of being chemically unreactive makes them attractive solvents for many reactions because they will not interfere with the desidere chemistry. However, their usefulness is limited because they will not dissolve highly polar or ionic compounds because of their completely nonpolar nature.</p>

<h2>GPL</h2>

<p>GPL è l'acronimo di Gas di petrolio liquefatto ed è una miscela derivata dalla distillazione di idrocarburi principalmente composta da propano e butano. Questi due gas hanno la caratteristica di passare dallo stato gassoso allo stato liquido appena vengono sottoposti a pressioni di 3-4 bar e/o a basse temperature. Ciò ne consente e ne favorisce l'utilizzo, anche in piccoli contenitori, in quanto allo stato liquido questi gas sono facilmente trattabili e trasportabili in recipienti a bassa pressione (auto cisterne, ferro cisterne, bombole).</p>

<p>Il nome deriva quindi dal fatto che i componenti sono in forma gassosa a temperatura ambiente ed a pressione atmosferica ma vengono liquefatti sotto l'effetto della pressione presente nel recipiente che li contiene per consentirne il trasporto. Si ottiene così il vantaggio di aumentare la densità del gas di circa 250 volte riducendone, al tempo stesso, l'ingombro a parità di massa e quindi di energia producibile. In questo modo è possibile utilizzare contenitori a pressione di dimensioni tutto sommato limitate che trasportano grandi quantità di gas. Il gpl allo stato gassoso ha una densità maggiore di quella dell'aria e pertanto è considerato un "gas pesante". A causa di tale caratteristica in caso di rilascio in atmosfera (ad esempio in conseguenza di una perdita) il gpl tende ad accumularsi nella parte bassa dell'ambiente contrariamente a quanto accade con il metano che è, invece, più leggero dell'aria e tende, dunque, a salire verso l'alto.</p>

<p>Miscelato con l'aria in determinate proporzioni (dal 2% al 10% circa di gas nell'aria) il gpl forma una miscela infiammabile che si accende istantaneamente se innescata da una fiamma o da una scintilla. Il gpl è, in origine, inodore ma viene odorizzato con etantiolo in modo che eventuali perdite siano avvertibili dalle persone attraverso l'olfatto. Il gpl non è tossico ma asfissiante ad alte concentrazioni per cui è, comunque, bene evitare di respirarlo. Allo stato liquido, a causa della sua rapida evaporazione, se viene a contatto con la pelle o con gli occhi può provocare lesioni da ustioni da freddo.</p>

<h2>Methane</h2>

<p>In order to get a useful amount of gaseous fuel into a reasonably-sized tank, you have to liquify it. Some fuels are easier to liquify than others. According to the textbook Organic Chemistry by Joseph M. Hornback, propane has a boiling point of -44° F (-42° C) at atmospheric pressure, but methane (natural gas), has a boiling point of -260° F (-162° C) at atmospheric pressure. This means that methane has to be cooled to a much lower temperature than propane in order to be turned to a liquid that can be stored in a tank. Propane molecules consist of three carbon atoms bonded in a chain with eight hydrogen atoms bonded to these carbon atoms. In contrast, a methane molecule is just one carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms. Methane molecules have a high degree of symmetry. As a result, they do not have a permanent electric dipole. Bonding between permanent dipoles is the dominant bonding mechanism between molecules as they liquify for many substances such as water. Methane's symmetry, and therefore lack of a permanent electric dipole, means that its molecules can only bond through a much weaker effect known as the London dispersion force or the van der Waals force. In this effect, molecules induce temporary dipoles in each other, and these dipoles then bond. Because this bonding mechanism is so weak, the methane molecules have to be cooled to a low temperature until they are still enough to bond and form a liquid. In contrast, propane does not require as low a temperature to liquify.</p>

<p>But household propane is not usually kept in a liquid state by a low temperature. Instead, high pressure is used. In order to keep propane a liquid at room temperature (70° F or 21° C), it has to be held in a tank at a pressure of about 850 kPa. This can be accomplished with a strong metal tank. In contrast, to keep methane a liquid at room temperature requires a tank that can maintain a pressure of about 32,000 kPa. Household metal tanks cannot withstand this pressure. In short, methane is not stored in household tanks because the symmetry of its molecule makes it hard to liquify. You could in principle store methane in a tank in the gas state, but methane has such low density in the gas state that you could not store a usable amount. Instead, natural gas is processed and stored at refinery plants and then pumped to households in the gas state through pipes. The properties of different basic fuels are summarized below, showing nicely the trend in room temperature liquid pressures. Note that the pressures are approximate.</p>
