<h1>Hydroboration-oxidation</h1>

<p>Borane, BH<sub>3</sub>, adds to double bonds without catalytic activation, a reaction called hydroboration by its discoverer, H. C. Brown.</p>

<p>Hydroboration-oxidation of alkenes is a valuable laboratory method for the regioselective and stereoselective hydration of alkenes. Furthermore, this sequence of reactions occurs without <a href="carbocation_rearrangements.html">rearrangement</a>.</p>

<p><b>Hydroboration</b> is the addition of borane, BH<sub>3</sub>, to an alkene to form a trialkylborane. The overall reaction occurs in three successive steps. BH<sub>3</sub> reacts with one molecule of
alkene to form an alkylborane, then with a second molecule of alkene to form a dialkylborane, and finally with a third molecule of alkene to form a <b>trialkylborane</b>.</p>

<h3>Mechanism</h3>

<p><b>Step 1</b>: The addition of borane to an alkene is initiated by coordination of the vacant 2<i>p</i> orbital of boron with the electron pair of the &pi; bond. This coordination is a Lewis acid-base interaction, analogous to the coordination of THF to borane shown above. We designate this coordination with an arrow from the alkene to the boron.</p>

<p><b>Step 2</b>. Both of the other two B&minus;H bonds also add to alkene molecules. The overall result is that one botane molecule reacts with three alkene molecules to produce a boron attached to three alkyl groups, a trialkylborante.</p>

<p><b>Step 3</b>. In the next step of the reaction, hydrogen peroxide breaks each C&minus;B bond, replacing them with C&minus;OH and B&minus;OH bonds.</p>

<p>Borane cannot be prepared as a pure compound because it dimerizes to diborane, B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, a toxic gas that ignites spontaneously in air.</p>

<p>However, BH<sub>3</sub> forms stable Lewis acid-base complexes with ethers. Borane is most often used as a commercially available solution of BH<sub>3</sub> in THF.</p>

<p>Boron, atomic number 5, has three electrons in its valence shell. To bond with three other atoms, boron uses <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals. The unoccupied 2<i>p</i> orbital of boron is perpendicular to the plane created by boron and the three other atoms to which it is bonded. An example of a stable, trivalent boron compound is boron trifluoride, BF<sub>3</sub>, a planar molecule with F&minus;B&minus;F bond angles of 120° (Section 1.2E). Because of the vacant 2<i>p</i> orbital in the valence shell of boron, BH<sub>3</sub>, BF<sub>3</sub>, and all other trivalent compounds of boron are electrophiles. These compounds of boron resemble carbocations, except that, unlike carbocations, they are electrically neutral. BH<sub>3</sub> is a planar molecule with H&minus;B&minus;H bond angles of 120° (see margin). Addition of borane to alkenes is regioselective and stereoselective.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Regioselective: upon addition of borane to an unsymmetrical alkene, boron be-comes bonded predominantly to the less substituted carbon of the double bond. (non-Markovnikov).</p></li>
	<li><p>Stereoselective: hydrogen and boron add from the same face of the double bond; that is, the reaction is <b>syn</b> (from the same side) stereoselective.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Both the regioselectivity and syn stereoselectivity are illustrated by hydroboration of 1-methylcyclopentene.</p>
