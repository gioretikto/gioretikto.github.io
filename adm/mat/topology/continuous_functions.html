<h1>Continuous functions</h1>

<p>Continuous functions represent key tools for comparing topological spaces and for identifying their topological properties. <br> To a topologist, a <b>map</b> is a <b>continuous function</b> from one <b>space</b> to another.</p>

<p>From calculus, the term <i>continuous function</i> should remind us of an unbroken grapg, usually presenting an equation in <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> such as the rule <i>y</i> = <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, which transform real numbers <i>x</i> into their squares, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>. The square of <i>x</i> = 2 is 4, but notice also that if <i>x</i> is <I>close</i> to 2, say, <i>x</i> = 2.9 or <i>x</i> = 3.002143, then <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> is also <i>close</i> to 9. Thus all points (<i>x</i>- values) is a small <i>neighborhood</i> remain relatively close together after the function has been applied; hence we say that a continuous function <i>preserves closeness</i>.</p>

<p>If we consider the constant function <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) = 0, which takes as input any point of the number line, agives the value 0 as output. The entire output set of <i>f</i> consists of a single point. which is very different from the real line, thus not every continuous map preserves the essential nature of a space. However, every two points <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> which are close in ℝ are also close in {0} are close, since f(<i>a</i>) = f(<i>b</i>) = 0 and the distance from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> is 0.</p>

<p><b>Definition 3.1.1 (Continuous Functions)</b>. A function <i>f</i> : (<i>X,τ<sub>X</sub></i>) → (<i>Y,τ<sub>Y</sub></i>) is said to be continuous if and only if for every open set <i>U</i> in <i>Y</i>, <i>f</i><sup>−1</sup>(<i>U</i>) is open in <i>X</i>. In other words, a function <i>f</i> is continuous if <i>f</i><sup>−1</sup> maps open sets into open sets. &emsp;□</p>

<p>To check continuity, you need to check all opens in the codomain, and see if thery are mapped by <i>f</i><sup>−1</sup> to open sets.</p>

<p>Continuity expressed in terms of open sets is more general and applied to functions defined on topological spaces; Definition 3.1.1 agrees with that introduced in calculus for metric spaces, however it does not require to introduce a metric.</p>

<p><b>Lemma 3.1.2</b>. Let <i>f</i> : <i>S</i> → <i>T</i> be a function between two topological spaces. Then <i>f</i> is continuous if, and only if, <i>f</i><sup>−1</sup> (<i>U</i>) is closed whenever <i>U</i> is a closed subset of <i>T</i>.</p>

<p><b>Proof</b> First let us assume that <i>f</i> is continuous, i.e., <i>f</i><sup>−1</sup> (<i>V</i>) is open whenever V is an open subset of <i>T</i>. If <i>U</i> ⊂ <i>T</i> is closed, then <i>T</i> − <i>U</i> is open, so <i>f</i><sup>−1</sup> (<i>T</i> − <i>U</i>) is open. However, f<sup>−1</sup> (<i>T</i> − <i>U</i>) = <i>S</i> − <i>f</i><sup>−1</sup> (<i>U</i>), so the complement of f<sup>−1</sup> (<i>U</i>) is open, i.e., f<sup>−1</sup> (<i>U</i>) is closed.</p>

<p>For the converse, supposing <i>f</i> is continuous we have</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>f</i><sup>−1</sup>(<i>U</i>) is open for all open <i>U</i> &emsp;⇐⇒&emsp; <i>f</i><sup>−1</sup>(<i>U<sup>c</sup></i>) is open for all closed <i>U</i> &emsp;⇐⇒&emsp; [<i>f</i><sup>−1</sup>(<i>U<sup>c</sup></i>)]<sup>c</sup> is closed for all closed <i>U</i>. &emsp;□</p>
</div>

<p><p><b>Proposition 3.1.3</b>. (Intermediate Value Theorem) Let (<i>X,τ</i>) and (<i>Y,τ'</i>) be topological spaces and <i>f</i> : (<i>X, τ</i>) → (<i>Y, τ'</i>) surjective and continuous. If (<i>X, τ</i>) is connected, then (<i>Y, τ'</i>) is connected.</p>

<p><b>Proof</b>. Suppose (<i>Y,τ'</i>) is not connected. Then it has a clopen subset <i>U</i> such that <i>U</i> &ne; Ø and <i>U</i> &ne; <i>Y</i> . Then <i>f</i><sup>−1</sup> (<i>U</i>) is an open set, since <i>f</i> is continuous, and also a closed set, by Lemma 3.1.2; that is, <i>f</i><sup>−1</sup> (<i>U</i>) is a clopen subset of <i>X</i>. Now <i>f</i><sup>−1</sup> (<i>U</i>) &ne; Ø as <i>f</i> is surjective and <i>U</i> &ne; Ø. Since <i>f</i> is surjective <i>f</i>(<i>X</i>) = <i>Y</i>, so <i>f</i>(<i>X</i>) can't be some proper subset of <i>Y</i> such as <i>U</i> and we can conclude that <i>f</i><sup>−1</sup> (<i>U</i>) &ne; <i>X</i>, as well. Thus (<i>X, τ</i>) is not connected. This is a contradiction. Therefore (<i>Y, τ'</i>) is connected. &emsp;□</p>

<p><b>Definition 3.1.4</b> A topological space (<i>X,τ</i>) is said to be <b>path-connected</b> (or <b>pathwise connected</b>) if for each pair of (distinct) points <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> of <i>X</i> there exists a continuous mapping <i>f</i> : [0, 1] → (<i>X, τ</i>) , such that <i>f</i> (0) = <i>a</i> and <i>f</i> (1) = <i>b</i>. The mapping <i>f</i> is said to be a path joining <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>. </p>
