<h1>Conic Sections</h1>

<p>A conic section (or simply conic) is a <b>curve</b> obtained as the intersection of the surface of a cone with a plane. The three types of conic sections are the hyperbola, the parabola, and the ellipse. The circle is type of ellipse, and is sometimes considered to be a fourth type of conic section.</p>

<p>Conic sections can be generated by intersecting a plane with a cone. A cone has two identically shaped parts called <b>nappes</b>. One nappe is what most people mean by “cone,” and has the shape of a party hat.</p>

<p>Conic sections are generated by the intersection of a plane with a cone. If the plane is parallel to the axis of revolution (the <i>y</i>-axis), then the conic section is a <a href="iperbole.html">hyperbola</a>. If the plane is parallel to the generating line, the conic section is a <a href="parabola.html">parabola</a>. If the plane is perpendicular to the axis of revolution, the conic section is a <a href="circonferenza.html">circle</a>. If the plane intersects one nappe at an angle to the axis (other than 90°), then the conic section is an <a href="ellisse.html">ellipse</a>.</p>
