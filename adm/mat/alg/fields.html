<h1>Fields</h1>

<p>It was also Dedekind who baptized what we know as fields (with the German word Körper, literally “body”), because it " denotes a system with a certain completeness, fullness and self-containment". </p>

<p>The most useful number systems are those in which we can divide by nonzero elements (we've already touched on the notion of a <a href="rings.html#field">field</a>). A <b>field</b> is a <a href="rings.html">ring</a> in which the nonzero elements form an abelian group under multiplication. In other words, a field is a nontrivial commutative ring <i>R</i> satisfying the following extra axiom.</p>

<p>For each nonzero element <i>a</i> ∈ <i>R</i> there exists <i>a</i><sup>−1</sup> ∈ <i>R</i> such that <i>a</i> · <i>a</i><sup>−1</sup> = 1.</p>

<p id="field"><b>Definition 6.1.3</b>. A <a href="rings.html">ring</a> <i>F</i>, is a <b>field</b> provided these conditions hold:</p></li>
	
	<ol>
		<li><p><i>F</i> is a commutative ring: axioms from A1 to A5 are satisfied;</p></li>
		<li><p>Ring axioms for multiplication from M1 to M3 and D1 are satisfied;</p></li>
		<li><p>M4: <i>F</i> contains an element <i>e</i> &ne; 0 such that e<i>x</i> = <i>x</i> for every <i>x</i> &in; <i>F</i>; <i>e</i> is called unity;</p></li>
		<li><p>M5: Every nonzero element of <i>F</i> has a multiplicative inverse: If <i>x</i> &in; <i>F</i> and <i>x</i> &ne; 0 then there exists an element 1/<i>x</i> &in; <i>F</i> such that <i>x</i> ⋅ (l/<i>x</i>) = 1. &emsp;□</p></li>
	</ol>

<p>Another way to look at the definition of a <i>field</i> is this: It is a commutative ring in which one can always solve equations of the form <i>ax</i> = <i>b</i> (when <i>a</i> &ne; 0). The solution is, of course, <i>x</i> = <i>a</i><sup>−1</sup> <i>b</i>. In other words: In all rings we can add, subtract, and multiply, but in fields we can also divide. Or to say this yet another way, a field is a commutative ring with unity for which all non-zero elements are <i>associates</i> of one another. ℚ, ℝ and ℂ, are familiar examples of <i>fields</i>. We have seen that if <i>p</i> is a prime, then ℤ<sub><i>p</i></sub> is a field.</p>

<p>The rings ℚ, ℝ and ℂ are all fields, but the integers do not form a field.</p>

<p><b>Proposition 6.1.4</b>. The axioms for multiplication in a field imply the following statements.</p>

<ol type="a">
	<li><p>If <i>x</i> &ne; 0 and <i>xy</i> = <i>xz</i> then <i>y</i> = <i>z</i>;</p></li>
	<li><p>If <i>x</i> &ne; 0 and <i>xy</i> = <i>x</i> then <i>y</i> = 1;</p></li>
	<li><p>If <i>x</i> &ne; 0 and <i>xy</i> = 1 then <i>y</i> = 1/<i>x</i>.</p></li>
	<li><p>If <i>x</i> &ne; 0 then 1/(1/<i>x</i>) = <i>x</i>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>Proof</b>. (a) By axiom (M5) there exists an element 1/<i>x</i> such that 1/<i>x</i> = 1. By (M2) and (M3) we have (1/<i>x</i>) (<i>xy</i>) = (1/<i>x</i><i>x</i>) <i>y</i> = 1<i>y</i> = 1<i>y</i> = <i>y</i>, and similarly (1/<i>x</i>) (<i>xz</i>) <i>z</i>. Hence <i>y</i> = <i>z</i>. <br> (b) Apply (a) with <i>z</i> = 1. <br> (c) Apply (a) with <i>z</i> = 1/<i>x</i>. <br>(d) Apply (a) with <i>x</i> replaced by 1/<i>x</i>, <i>y</i> = 1/(1/<i>x</i>) and <i>z</i> = <i>x</i>.&emsp;□</p>

<p id="field_integraldomain"><b>Proposition 6.1.5</b> Every field <i>F</i> is an integral domain</p>

<p><b>Proof.</b> Let <i>F</i> be a field. Suppose that <i>a, b</i> &in; <i>F</i>, where <i>a</i> &ne; 0 and <i>a</i> ⋅ <i>b</i> = 0. Since <i>a</i> &ne; 0, there exists a multiplicative inverse <i>a</i><sup>−1</sup> to <i>a</i>. By the associativity of the multiplication, we have</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>a</i><sup>−1</sup> ⋅ (<i>a</i>⋅<i>b</i>) = (<i>a</i><sup>−1</sup> ⋅ <i>a</i>) ⋅ <i>b</i> = 1 ⋅ <i>b</i> = 0</p>
</div>

<p>and hence <i>b</i> = 0. Thus, we have an integral domain.□</p>

<p>The converse of proposition 6.1.5 is false in general (ℤ is an integral domain that is not a field), but true in the finite case.</p>

<p><b>6.1.6 Proposition.</b> Every finite Integral domain <i>R</i> is a field.</p>

<p><b>Proof</b>. Since <i>R</i> is a commutative ring with identity, we need only show that for each <i>a</i> &ne; 0<sub><i>R</i></sub>, the equation <i>ax</i> = 1<sub><i>R</i></sub> has a solution. Let <i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>a</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., <i>a<sub>n</sub></i>. be the distinct elements of <i>R</i> and suppose <i>a<sub>s</sub></i> &ne; 0<sub><i>R</i></sub>. To show that <i>a<sub>s</sub></i>x &ne; 1<sub><i>R</i></sub> has a solution, consider the products <i>a<sub>s</sub>a</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>a<sub>s</sub>a</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., <i>a<sub>s</sub>a<sub>n</sub></i>. If <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> &ne; <i>a<sub>j</sub></i>, then we must have <i>a<sub>s</sub>a<sub>i</sub></i> &ne; <i>a<sub>s</sub>a<sub>j</sub></i> (because <i>a<sub>s</sub>a<sub>j</sub></i> = <i>a<sub>s</sub>a<sub>j</sub></i> would imply that <i>a<sub>s</sub></i> = <i>a<sub>j</sub></i> by cancellation). Therefore, <i>a<sub>s</sub>a</i><sub>1</sub>, ..., <i>a<sub>s</sub>a<sub>n</sub></i>, are <i>n</i> distinct elements of <i>R</i>. However, <i>R</i> has exactly <i>n</i> elements all together, and so these must be all the elements of <i>R</i> in some order. In particular, for some <i>j</i>, <i>a<sub>s</sub>a<sub>j</sub></i> = 1<sub><i>R</i></sub>. Therefore, the equation <i>a<sub>s</sub>x</i> = 1<sub><i>R</i></sub> has a solution and <i>R</i> is a field. &emsp;□</p>

<p>called addition and multiplication, which satisfy the following axioms:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p><i>F</i> is an Abelian group under the "addition" operation +. The additive identity is called the <b>zero</b> and is denoted by 0;</p></li>

	<li><p>Multiplication is associative and commutative and makes the set <i>F</i>* = <i>F</i> \ {0} of nonzero elements of <i>F</i> is an Abelian group under the "multiplication" operation '⋅'. The multiplicative identity is called the <b>unity</b> and is denoted by 1;</p></li>

	<li><p>The multiplication operation '⋅' distributes over the addition operation +; that is <i>a</i> ⋅ (<i>b</i> + <i>c</i>) = <i>a</i> ⋅ <i>b</i> + <i>a</i> ⋅ <i>c</i>, for every <i>a,b,c</i> &in; <i>F</i>. &emsp;□</p>
</ol>

<p>From the definition, we see that a field consists of two groups with respect to two operations, addition and multiplication. The group with respect to addition is called the <i>additive group</i> of the field, and the group with respect to multiplicatoin is called the <i>multiplicative group</i> of the field. Since these two groups must contain an identity element, a field must contain at least two elements. In a field the additive inverse of an element <i>a</i> is denoted by '−<i>a</i>', and the mutliplicative inverse of <i>a</i> is denoted <i>a</i><sup>−1</sup>, provided that <i>a</i> &ne; 0.</p>

<p>The properties satisfied by a field <i>F</i>, are more extensive than the four <a href="groups.html">group axioms</a> applied to both binary operations. Recall that ℝ under standard addition is an Abelian group. On the other hand, ℝ under standard multplication is not a group − although it comes very close: the inverse property is not satisfied, and it fails for just one real number, zero. By removing the zero and considering the set ℝ* = ℝ\{0} we have a multiplicative group. Indeed, the first group axiom holds since the product of any two nonzero real numbers is still nonzero. Multiplication of real numbers is associative, 1 plays the role of an identity element, and 1/<i>a</i> gives the inverse of an element <i>a</i> &in; ℝ*. Thus ℝ* is a group under multiplication. <br> Similarly, we have the groups ℚ* of all nonzero rational numbers and ℂ* of all nonzero complex numbers, under the operation of ordinary multiplication. If we attempt to form a multiplicative group from the integers ℤ, we have to restrict ourselves to just 1, since these are the only integers that have multiplicative inverses in ℤ.</p>

<p>There are, on the other hand, fields whose elements are not numbers, for example, ℤ<sub><i>p</i></sub> is a (finite) field for every prime number <i>p</i>.</p>

<h2 id="subfields">Subfields</h2>

<p>ℤ is a <a href="subrings.html">subring</a> of the ring ℚ of rational numbers and ℚ is a subring of the field ℝ of all real numbers. Since ℚ is itself a field, we say that ℚ is a <b>subfietd</b> of ℝ.
Similarly, ℝ is a subfield of the field ℂ of complex numbers. Then a <b>subfield</b> of a field <i>K</i> is a subring which is a field. Equivalently, it is a subset <i>F</i> of <i>K</i> satisying the <a href="subrings.html">subring Criterion</a> i.e. containing at least two elements, such that</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>a, b</i> ∈ <i>F</i> &emsp;⇒&emsp; <i>a</i> − <i>b</i> ∈ <i>F</i>, &emsp;&emsp; <i>a</i> ∈ <i>F</i>, <i>b</i> ∈ <i>F</i> \ {0} &emsp;⇒&emsp; <i>ab</i><sup>−1</sup> ∈ <i>F</i></p>
