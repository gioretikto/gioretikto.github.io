<h1>The Method of Exhaustion</h1>

<p>Formulas for the areas of polygons, such as squares, rectangles, triangles, and trapezoids, were well known in many early civilizations. However, the problem of finding formulas for reagions with curved boundaries (a circle being the simplest example) caused difficulties for early mathematicians.</p>

<p>The <i>method of exchaustion</i> initiated by Antiphon the Sophist (<i>ca.</i> 430 B.C.), perfected by Eudoxus, and put to such excelence use by Archimedes that, if popular demand for a unique originator must be satisfies, he, rather than Newton and Leibniz, should be credited with the invetion of integral calculus.</p>

<p>Archimedes based his method on the simple observation that if a circle is inscribed and circumscribed by two polygons of <i>n</i> sides, then as <i>n</i> increases, the gap between the circumference of the circle and the perimeters of the inscribed and circumscribed polygons keeps diminishing, with the perimeters of the polygons and the circle becoming nearly, although never exactly, identical. Or in other words, as n increases, the difference in area between the polygons and the circle will be gradually exhausted without ever becoming zero. Figure 1 shows a circle enclosed between an inscribed regular hexagon ABCDEF and a circumscribed regular hexagon RSTUVW. </p>

<p>It is convenient to begin with a regular hexagon, since its construction with straightedge and compass is a fairly simple matter. First draw the circle. Then, with the
compass still set to the radius of the circle, start at any point on the circumference and mark off the vertices A, B, C, D, E, and F. Draw tangents to the circle at each of these points, and join them to give the circumscribed hexagon RSTUVW. Then given the inscribed polygon ABCDEF, it is possible next to construct a 12-sided polygon by bisecting the arc subtended on each of the sides of ABCDEF and joining each of the additional six points to the two original vertices that are adjacent. As an illustration, if G is the midpoint of the arc AF, then joining F to G, and G to A, will give two of the sides of the 12-sided inscribed polygon.
And if, at each of the 12 vertices of the new polygon, tangents are drawn to the circle, we obtain the corresponding circumscribed 12-sided polygon. This process can be carried on to obtain regular polygons of 24, 48, 96, . . . sides. Archimedes stopped at 96-sided polygons. Now, if the perimeters of the inscribed and circumscribed polygons of n sides are denoted by pn and Pn respectively, and C is the circumference of
the circle, it follows that</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>p</i><sub>6</sub> &lt; <i>p</i><sub>12</sub> &lt; <i>p</i><sub>24</sub> &lt; <i>p</i><sub>96</sub> &lt; ... &lt; <i>C</i> &lt; <i>P</i><sub>96</sub> &lt; <i>P</i><sub>48</sub> &lt; <i>P</i><sub>24</sub> &lt; <i>P</i><sub>6</sub></p>
</div>

<p>It can be shown with modern mathematics that <i>p<sub>n</sub></i> and <i>P<sub>n</sub></i> converge to C as n tends to infinity. Next, it is easily established that the perimeter of the inscribed regular hexagon <i>p</i><sub>6</sub> is 3<i>d</i>, where <i>d</i> is the diameter, and also that the perimeter of the circumscribed regular hexagon, <i>P</i><sub>6</sub> , is 2√3<i>d</i> . Starting with <i>p</i><sub>6</sub> , Archimedes found close approximations to <i>p</i><sub>12</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>24</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>48 </sub>, and <i>p</i><sub>96</sub> . Then from <i>P</i><sub>6</sub> he approximated <i>P</i><sub>12</sub> to <i>P</i><sub>96</sub>. Since <i>p</i><sub>96</sub> < <i>C</i> < <i>P</i><sub>96</sub> , he concluded that</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>3 + 10/71 &lt; &pi; &lt; 3 + 1/7</p>
</div>

<p>A circle with inscribed and circumscribed polygons illustrates the principle of exhaustion method of measuring the value of &pi;. This method was used by many scholars, but probably the clearest description of this method was given by Archimedes. Essentially, it is a limiting process in which a unit circle (radius =1) is squeezed between two regular polygons - one inscribed in the circle, and one circumscribed about the circle. For each value of <i>n</i>, the perimeter or area of the inscribed polygon is less than the circumference or area of the circle, and the perimeter or area of the circumscribed polygon is greater than the circumference or are of the cricle. The lower boundary (inscribed polygon) approaches  the circle as a limit as <i>n</i> becomes infinitely large. The upper boundary (circumscribed polygon) approaches the circle as a limit as <i>n</i> becomes infinitely large. The circumference and area of the cricle are between these two boundaries. As <i>n</i> increases, so does the accuracy of the approximations for the circumference and area of the circle, and likewise, the accuracy (number of digits) of the approximation of &pi; also increases. Hence the name <b>Exhaustion</b> as the sequence of polygons fill up or <i>exhaust</i> the circle.</p>




<p>It is important to remember that Greeks did not have the same tools we have today. How were they able to construct such accurate polygons that were inscribed within the circles? Well the answer is that they used a straight edge and a compass. This would only work for specific polygons. “In 1837, mathematician Carl Gauss was able to prove that a n-polygon could be constructed with a compass and straight edge if and only if n is the product of a power of 2 and any number of the Fermat primes m = 22k,” wrote Chelsea E. DeSouza in The Greek Method of Exhaustion: Leading the Way to Modern Integration. The first polygons that would able to be constructed would be 3=2+1, 4=2<sup>2</sup>, 5=2<sup>2</sup>+1, 6= 2(2+1), 8 =23, 10=2(2<sup>2</sup>+1), 12=2<sup>2</sup>(3), 16=2<sup>4</sup>, 2<sup>4</sup>+1. Not all polygons were able to be constructed with a compass and straight edge.</p>
