<h1>Exercise on combinatorics</h1>

<ol>
	<li><p>Jones has 10 books that he is going to put on his bookshelf. Of these, 4 are mathematics books, 3 are chemistry books, 2 are Physics books, and 1 is a Biology book. Joe wants to arrange his books so that all the books dealing with the same subject are together on the shelf. How many different arrangements are possible?</p></li>
	
	<li><p>Calculate the probability to get a 6 at the Superenalotto</p></li>

	<li><p>Dieci amici che non si vedono da tempo si incontrano per una cena e ciascuno di loro saluta ognuno dei partecipanti abbracciandolo. Quanti abbracci si scambiano in totale?</p></li>

</ol>

<h2>Solutions</h2>

<ol>
	<li><p>There are 4!3!2!1! arrangements such that the mathematics books are first in line, then the chemistry books, then the history books, and then the language book. Similarly, for each possible ordering of the subjects, there are 4!3!2!1! possible arrangements. Hence, as there are 4! possible orderings of the subjects, the desired answer is 4! 4! 3! 2! 1! = 6912. ■</p></li>
	
	<li><p>Probability to get a 6: 1/C<sub>90,6</sub> = 1/622614630 = 0.000000160613%.</p></li>

	<li><p>10⋅9/2! = 45. &emsp;■</p>
