<h1>Events and Sets</h1>

<p>Per formalizzare in modo matematicamente corretto la probabilità è necessario ricorrere alla interpretazione insiemistica, i.e. to make a mathematical theory of probability, we must express events (or wha can happen) as sets. An event which cannot be analyzed further, or need not to be analyzed further, is called an <i>elementary event</i>. Elementary events need not be atomic events that cannot be dissected further into more basic events. For example, when we cast a dice, usually we regard a particular face 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 to be up as an elemenary event. However, if we pay attension only to the even-odd properties of the numbers, the elementary events could be "even" and "odd". On the other hand, if we wish to use the direction of the edges as well as the faces, then 1, ..., 6 are no longer elementary events. </p>

<p><b>Definition 2.1.1</b>. The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is called the <b>sample space</b> and is denoted by &Omega;. &emsp;□</p>

<p>Any (compound) event is identified with a subset of &Omega;. </p>

<p><b>Example 2.1.2</b>. A coin is tossed. There are two possible outcomes, heads (denoted by H) and tails (denoted by T), so that &Omega; = {H, T}. We may be interested in the possible occurrences of the following events:</p>

<ol type="a">
	<li><p>the outcome is a head;</p></li>
	<li><p>the outcome is either a head or a tail;</p></li>
	<li><p>the outcome is both a head and a tail (this seems very unlikely to occur);</p></li>
	<li><p>the outcome is not a head.&emsp;■</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>Example 2.1.3</b>. A die is thrown once. There are six possible outcomes depending on which of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 is uppermost. Thus &Omega; = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. We may be interested in the following events:</p>

<ol type="a">
	<li><p>the outcome is the number 1;</p></li>
	<li><p>the outcome is an even number;</p></li>
	<li><p>the outcome is even but does not exceed 3;</p></li>
	<li><p>the outcome is not even.&emsp;■</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We see immediately that each of the events of these examples can be specified as a subset <i>A</i> of the appropriate sample space &Omega;. In the first example they can be rewritten as</p>

<ol type="a">
	<li><p><i>A</i> = {H},</p></li>
	<li><p><i>A</i> = {H} &union; {T},</p></li>
	<li><p><i>A</i> = {H} ∩ {T},</p></li>
	<li><p><i>A</i> = {H}<sup>c</sup>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>whilst those of the second example become</p>

<ol type="a">
	<li><p><i>A</i> = {1},</p></li>
	<li><p><i>A</i> = {2,4,6},</p></li>
	<li><p><i>A</i> = {2,4,6} ∩ {1,2,3},</p></li>
	<li><p><i>A</i> = {2,4,6}<sup>c</sup>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The <i>complement</i> of a subset <i>A</i> of &Omega; is denoted here and subsequently by <i>A<sup>c</sup></i>; from now on, subsets of &Omega; containing a single member, such as {H}, will usually be written without the containing braces. <br> Henceforth we think of events as subsets of the sample space &Omega;. Whenever <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are events in which we are interested, then we can reasonably concern ourselves also with the events <i>A</i> ∪ <i>B</i>, <i>A</i> ∩ <i>B</i>, and <i>A<sup>c</sup></i>, representing ‘<i>A</i> or <i>B</i>’,‘ <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>’, and ‘not <i>A</i>’ respectively. Events <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are called disjoint if their intersection is the empty set ∅; ∅ is called the impossible event. The set &Omega; is called the certain event, since some member of &Omega; will certainly occur. <br> Thus events are subsets of &Omega;, but need all the subsets of &Omega; be events? The answer is no, but some of the reasons for this are too difficult to be discussed here. It suffices for us to think of the collection of events as a subcollection ℱ of the set of all subsets of &Omega;. This subcollection should have certain properties in accordance with the earlier examples:</p>

<ol type="a">
	<li><p>if <i>A, B</i> ∈ ℱ then <i>A</i> ∪ <i>B</i> ∈ ℱ and <i>A</i> ∩ <i>B</i> ∈ <i>F</i>;</p></li>
	<li><p>if <i>A</i> ∈ ℱ then <i>A<sup>c</sup></i> ∈ ℱ;</p></li>
	<li><p>the empty set ∅ belongs to ℱ.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any collection ℱ of subsets of &Omega; which satisfies these three conditions is called a <b>field</b>. It follows from the properties of a field ℱ that</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>if <i>A</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>A</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., <i>A<sub>n</sub></i> &in; ℱ then ⋃<sub><i>i</i>=1</sub><sup><i>n</i></sup> <i>A<sub>i</sub></i> &in; ℱ</p>
</div>

<p>that is to say, <i>ℱ</i> is closed under finite unions and hence under finite intersections also (see Problem (1.8.3)). This is fine when &Omega; is a finite set, but we require slightly more to deal with the common situation when &Omega; is infinite, as the following example indicates.</p>

<p><b>Example 2.1.4</b>. A coin is tossed repeatedly until the first head turns up; we are concerned with the number of tosses before this happens. The set of all possible outcomes is the set &Omega; = {<i>ω</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>ω</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>ω</i><sub>3</sub>, ...}, where <i>ω<sub>i</sub></i> denotes the outcome when the first <i>i</i> − 1 tosses are tails and the i th toss is a head. We may seek to assign a probability to the event <i>A</i>, that the first head occurs after an even number of tosses, that is, <i>A</i> = {<i>ω</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>ω</i><sub>4</sub>, <i>ω</i><sub>6</sub>, ...}. This is an infinite countable union of members of &Omega; and we require that such a set belong to <i>ℱ</i> in order that we can discuss its probability.&emsp;■</p>

<p>Thus we also require that the collection of events be closed under the operation of taking countable unions. Any collection of subsets of &Omega; with these properties is called a σ-field (or sometimes a σ-algebra).</p>

<p><b>Definition 2.1.5</b> (<i>&sigma;</i>-algebra). Ogni famiglia <i>ℱ</i> di sottinsiemi di <i>&Omega;</i> is called a <i>&sigma;</i>-algebra if it satisfies the following conditions:</p>

<ol tpye="a">
	<li><p>∅ &in; <i>ℱ</i> (the empty set ∅ belongs to ℱ)</p></li>
	<li><p>if a countable collection of subsets <i>A</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>A</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., &in; <i>ℱ</i>, then</p>

<p>Condition 1) could have also be expressed by &Omega; &in; ℱ since by the third axiom (a &sigma;-algebra is closed under complementation), so specifying that the empty set is in ℱ is equivalent to specifying that the whole sample space is in ℱ.</p>

<p><b>Example 2.1.6</b>. The smallest <i>&sigma;</i>-field associates with &Omega; is the collection <i>ℱ</i> = {∅, &Omega;}.&emsp;■</p>

<p><b>Example 2.1.7</b>. If <i>A</i> is any subset of &Omega; then ℱ = {∅, <i>A</i>, A<sup>c</sup>, &Omega;} is a &sigma;-algebra.&emsp;■</p>

<p><b>Example 2.1.8</b>. The <a href="../algebra/sets.html#power">power set</a> of &Omega;, which is written {0, 1}<sup>&Omega;</sup> and contains all subsets of &Omega;, is obviously a σ-field. For reasons beyond the scope of this book, when &Omega; is infinite, its power set is too large a collection for probabilities to be assigned reasonably to all its members. &emsp;■</p>

<p>To recapitulate, with any experiment we may associate a pair (&Omega;, <i>ℱ</i>), where &Omega; is the set of all possible outcomes or <i>elementary events</i> and ℱ is a σ-ﬁeld of subsets of &Omega; which contains all the events in whose occurrences we may be interested; henceforth, to call a set <i>A</i> an <i>event</i> is equivalent to asserting that <i>A</i> belongs to the σ-ﬁeld in question. We usually translate statements about combinations of events into set-theoretic jargon; for example, the event that both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> occur is written as <i>A</i> ∩ <i>B</i>. Table 1.1 is a translation chart.</p>
