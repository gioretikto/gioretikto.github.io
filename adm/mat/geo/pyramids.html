<h1>Pyramids</h1>

<p>Pyramids are <a href="polyhedrons.html">polyhedrons</a>. The base of a <b>pyramid</b> is a polygon, and the three or more triangular faces of the pyramid meet at a point known as the apex. The most common type of pyramid that is usually encountered, are pyramids with a square base. There are also triangular based pyramids, <b>tetrahedrons</b>, and hexagonal-based pyramids and so on.</p>

<h2>Derive Volume of Square based Pyramid</h2>

<p>If we first consider a standard cube, where all sides are the same length. The volume of this cube is given by <i>a</i> × <i>a</i> × <i>a</i>, or <i>a</i><sup>3</sup>.</p>

<img src="img/pyramid_in_cube.png" alt="pyramid inscribed inside cube"/>

<p>As the volume of the cube is given by <i>a</i><sup>3</sup>, and as the pyramid is one of 6 equal sized pyramids that can fit inside the cube. The volume of this individual pyramid can be given by a<sup>3</sup>/6.</p>

<p>The pyramid has a height <i>h</i>, which is half the length of a cube side <i>a</i>. As the top of the pyramid is the center of the cube So with <i>h</i> = <i>a</i>/2​, it's the case that 2<i>h</i> = <i>a</i>. Putting this Information Together</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>V</i> = a<sup>3</sup>/6 = (<i>a</i> × <i>a</i><sup>2</sup>)/6 = (2<i>h</i> × <i>a</i><sup>2</sup>)/6 = 2<i>ha</i><sup>2</sup>/6 = <i>ha</i><sup>2</sup>/3</p>
