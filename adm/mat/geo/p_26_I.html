<h1>Proposizione I.26</h1>

<p>Prop. I.26, is the last of Euclid’s congruence theorems for triangles. Euclid proves both the familiar
 angle-side-angle (ASA) criterion, as well as angle-angle-side (AAS) for triangle congruence,
 with no reliance, tacit or otherwise, on the angle sum in a triangle.</p>

<p><b>Proposizione I.26</b> (ASA, AAS) - If triangles have two angles congruent to two
angles respectively, and either the sides between the two angles congruent, or
the sides opposite corresponding angles congruent, then the triangles themselves
are congruent</p>

<p><i>Proof</i> - Consider triangles ΔABC and ΔDEF where ∠ABC ≌ ∠DEF , BC ≌ EF, and ∠BCA ≌ ∠DFE. If AB ≌ DE,
 we have SAS for ΔABC ≌ ΔDEF by <a href="prop4.html">Prop I.4</a>. Assume the result is false, then, so that AB ≆ DE.
 Without loss of generality, we may assume that AB &gt; DE.
Pick G on AB so that BG ≌ ED. We then have SAS for ΔGBC ≌ ΔDEF implying that ∠BCG ≌ ∠DFE. But ∠BCG is part of ∠BCA ≌ ∠DFE so ∠BCG
 must be less than ∠DFE. The contradiction leads us to conclude that, in this case, AB ≌ DE so ΔABC ≌ ΔDEF. This is the <i>ASA</i>.</p>

<p>Next, assume the two triangles satisfy AAS with ∠ABC ≌ ∠DEF, ∠ACB ≌ ∠DFE, and AB ≌ DE. If BC ≌ EF, we have SAS
for ΔABC ≌ ΔDEF. Assume the result is false, then, with BC &gt; EF. Pick H on BC so that BH ≌ EF. This gives us SAS for ΔABH ≌
 ∠ΔDFE. Since ∠AHB is exterior to ΔACH, ∠AHB &gt; ∠ACH = ∠ACB ≌ ∠DFE. This contradiction forces us to conclude that BC ≌ EF,
 thus, that ΔABC ≌ ΔDEF. This is the <i>AAS</i>. □</p>
