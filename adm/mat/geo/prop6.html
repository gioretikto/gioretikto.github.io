<h1>Proposizione I.6</h1>

<p>Proposition I.6 is a partial converse of <i>Pons Asinorum</i>. The result is not used much in the sequel but as the first instance in <i>The Elements</i> of an indirect
proof or proof by contradiction, the proof itself is of interest. In a <b>proof by contradiction</b>, we assume that the conclusion of the theorem is false and we
proceed to uncover a contradiction. The contradiction may violate a common notion, a postulate, an earlier result, or a hypothesis of the theorem itself. This
method of argument goes back at least to Plato and Aristotle.</p>

<p><b>Proposition I.6</b> If the base angles of a triangle are congruent, the sides opposite the base angles are also congruent.</p>

<p><i>Proof</i> Consider <i>ΔABC</i> where <i>∠ABC ≌ ∠BAC</i> and suppose the conclusion is false so that one of <i>AC</i> or <i>BC</i> is longer. Assume it is <i>AC</i>.
Choose a point <i>D</i> on <i>AC</i> so that <i>AD ≌ BC</i>. This gives us SAS for <i>ΔDAB ≌ ΔCAB</i>, which must then enclose equal areas. But as part of 
<i>ΔCAB, ΔDAB</i> must have smaller area than <i>ΔCAB</i> by <a href="commonnotions.html">CN5</a>. The contradiction forces us to conclude that <i>AC ≌ BC</i>.□</p>
