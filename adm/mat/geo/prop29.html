<h1>Proposizione I.29</h1>

<p>In Prop. I.29, where he invokes <a href="postulati.html">Postulate V</a> for the first time, Euclid
addresses the converse of both Prop. I.27 and I.28: If lines are parallel, then
certain conditions about the angles formed by a transversal hold.</p>

<p><b>Prop. 29</b> - Consider two lines with a transversal. If the two lines are
parallel then all of the following conditions hold.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Alternate interior angles formed by the transversal are congruent.</p></li>
	<li><p>Corresponding angles formed by the transversal are congruent.</p></li>
	<li><p>The two interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><i>Proof</i> - Suppose <span class="overline">AB</span> and <span class="overline">CD</span> are parallel.
 Assume (1) is false so, for example,∠AGH &gt; ∠GHD in the Fig. above. Since ∠AGH + ∠BGH = π, then ∠BGH +∠GHD &lt; π.
 By Postulate V, <span class="overline">AB</span> and <span class="overline">CD</span> meet on the B, D side of 
<span class="overline">EF</span>, a contradiction. We conclude that ∠AGH ≌ ∠GHD. Since this pair was an arbitrary choice of alternate interior angles, (1) must be true.
Next we argue that ∠EGB ≌ ∠GHD. By the Vertical Angle Theorem, ∠AGH ≌ ∠EGB. By (1), ∠AGH ≌ ∠GHD. We conclude by CN1 that
∠EGB ≌ ∠GHD, which proves (2). Finally, notice that ∠EGB + ∠BGH = π so ∠GHD + ∠BGH = π. This is enough to prove (3). □</p>
