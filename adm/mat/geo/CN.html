<h1>Common Notions</h1>

<p>Euclid cites five so-called common notions in addition to the definitions and postulates. The common notions are sometimes referred to as axioms in the
literature. They are distinguished from the postulates in that they are not specifically geometric, but refer to principles that apply both
within and without geometry.</p>

<p>CN1. Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.</p>
<p>CN2. If equals be added to equals, the wholes are equal.</p>
<p>CN3. If equals be subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.</p>
<p>CN4. Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.</p>
<p>CN5. The whole is greater than the part.</p>

<p>Euclid does not use symbols. We could restate CN1 and CN2 using symbols as follows:</p>

<oL>
<li><p>If a = b and c = b, then a = c.</p></li>
<li><p>If a = b, then a + c = b + c.</p></li>
</ol>
