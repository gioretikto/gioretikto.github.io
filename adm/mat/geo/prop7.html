<h1>Proposizione I.7</h1>

<p>Proposition I.7 Given two straight lines constructed from the ends of a straight line and meeting in a point, there cannot be constructed from the ends of the 
same straight line, and on the same side of it, two other straight lines meeting in another point and equal to the former two respectively, namely each equal to that
 from the same end.</p>

<p><b>Proposition I.7</b> If the base angles of a triangle are congruent, the sides opposite the base angles are also congruent.</p>

<p><i>Proof</i> Since AC equals <i>AD</i>, therefore the angle <i>ACD</i> equals the angle <i>ADC</i>, <a href="prop5.html">Proposition V</a>. 
By CN5, <i>ACD &gt; DCB</i> since <i>DCB</i> is part of <i>ACD</i>. By the property of magnitudes (not listed in CN):</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>If x &lt; y and y = z, then x &lt; z</p>
<p>DCB &lt; ACD and ACD = ADC then DCB &lt; ADC</p>
</div>

<p>follows that <i>ADC</i> is greater than the angle <i>DCB</i>.</p>

<p>Next, transitivity of “less than”</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>If x &lt; y and y &lt; z, then x &lt; z.</p>
</div>

<p>follows that the angle BDC is greater than ADC (CN5), and therefore BDC is greater than BCD.</p>

<p>Since <i>CB</i> equals <i>DB</i>, therefore the angle <i>CDB</i> also equals the angle <i>DCB</i>. But it was also proved greater than it, which is impossible: 
therefore the triangles constructed upon the same right line cannot have their conterminous sides equal, when the vertex of each of the triangles is without the other.
