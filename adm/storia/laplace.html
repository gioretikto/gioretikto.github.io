<h1>Pierre Simon Laplace</h1>

<p><b>Pierre Simon Laplace</b> (1749â€“1827) was born in Normandy, France, and was expected to become a clergyman until his mathematical talents were noticed at school. He made many important contributions to calculus, probability, and astronomy. He was an examiner of the young <a href="napoleone.html">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> at the Royal Artillery Corps and later, when Napoleon was in power, served briefly as Minister of the Interior and then Chancellor of the Senate. Laplace was granted the title of Count of the Empire in 1806 and received the title of Marquis de Laplace in 1817.</p>
