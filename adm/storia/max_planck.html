<h1>Max Planck</h1>

<p>Max Planck was born in Kiel, Germany (then Prussia) on April 23, 1858, and died in 1948. He showed early talent in both music and science. He received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics in 1879 at the University of Munich for his dissertation on the second law of thermodynamics. He joined the faculty of the University of Kiel in 1885, and in 1888 he was appointed director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics, which was formed for him at the University of Berlin, where he remained until 1926. His application of thermodynamics to physical chemistry won him an early international reputation. Planck was president of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, later renamed the Max Planck Society, from 1930 until 1937, when he was forced to retire by the Nazi government. Planck is known as the father of the quantum theory because of his theoretical work on blackbody radiation at the end of the 1890s, during which time he introduced a quantum hypothesis to achieve agreement between his theoretical equations and experimental data. He maintained his interest in thermodynamics throughout his long career in physics. Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1918 "in recognition of services he rendered to the advancement of physics by his discovery of energy quanta." Planck's personal life was clouded by tragedy. His two daughters died in childbirth, one son died in World War I, and another son was executed in World War II for his part in the assassination attempt on Hitler in 1944.</p>
