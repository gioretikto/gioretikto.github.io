<h1>Augustin Louis Cauchy</h1>

<p>Augustin Louis Cauchy, (21 August 1789 – 23 May 1857) French mathematician, has the distinction of being a major contributor to the development of modern calculus. The calculus that we know today is based substantially on his clear and precise definition of limits, which changed the whole complexion of the field. Cauchy’s attention was not confined to calculus, though. In 1814, he began to develop the theory of functions of complex variables. He made significant contributions in the areas of differential equations, infinite series, probability, determinants, and mathematical physics, as well as abstract algebra. The current notation and terminology used for permutations are credited to Cauchy. A major theorem in the study of abelian groups (Theorem 4.39) was proved by Cauchy and thus was named for him. <br> Cauchy was born in Paris on August 21, 1789. By the time he was 11 years old, French mathematicians recognized his rare talent. He went on to study civil engineering and spent the first few years of his career as an engineer in Napoleon’s army, pursuing mathematical research on the side. For health reasons, he gave up engineering and began a teaching career that was mathematically fruitful in spite of political unrest in France. In 1830, Cauchy, an ardent supporter of King Charles X, refused to swear allegiance to the new government after the exile of the king. He lost his professorship and was forced to leave France for eight
years. He subsequently taught in church schools and produced so many papers that the Academy of Sciences, alarmed at the printing bills that resulted, passed a rule limiting each paper to four pages. After the February Revolution of 1848, Cauchy was appointed professor of celestial mechanics at the École Polytechnique, a position he retained for the rest of his career.</p>
