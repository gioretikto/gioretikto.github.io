<h1>James Clerk Maxwell</h1>

<p>Born in Edinburgh, James Clerk Maxwell (1831 - 1879) was brought up in the Scottish countryside at Glenair. He was educated at home until, at the age of 10, he was sent to the Edinburgh Academy
where his unusual homemade clothes and distracted air earned him the nickname “Dafty”. But a lot was going on in his head and he wrote his first scientific paper at age 14. Maxwell went to Peterhouse, Cambridge in 1850 but then moved to Trinity College, where he gained a fellowship in 1854. There he worked on the perception of colour, and also put Michael Faraday’s ideas of lines of electrical force
onto a sound mathematical basis. In 1856 he Maxwell took up a chair in Natural Philosophy in Aberdeen where he worked on a theory of the rings of Saturn (confirmed by the Voyager spacecraft visits of the
1980’s) and, in 1858, married the College Principal’s daughter, Katherine Mary Dewar. In 1859, he was inspired by a paper of Clausius on diffusion in gases to conceive of his theory of speed distributions in gases, which, with its subsequent elaborations by <a href="Boltzmann.html">Boltzmann</a>, is known as the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. These triumphs were not enough to preserve him from the consequences of the merging of Aberdeen’s two Universities in 1860 when, incredibly, the powers that be decided that it was Maxwell out of the two Professors of Natural Philosophy who should be made redundant. He failed to obtain a chair at Edinburgh (losing out to Tait) but instead moved to King’s College London. There, he produced the world’s first colour photograph, came up with his theory of electromagnetism that proposed that light was an electromagnetic wave and explained its speed in terms of electrical properties, and chaired a committee to decide on a new system of units to incorporate the new understanding of the link between electricity and magnetism (and which became known as the ‘Gaussian’ system, or c.g.s. system – though ‘Maxwellian system’ would have been more appropriate). He also constructed his apparatus for measuring the viscosity of gases, verifying some of his predictions, but not others. In 1865, he resigned his chair at King’s and moved full time to Glenair, where he wrote his ‘Theory of Heat’ which introduced what are now known as Maxwell relations (Chapter 16) and the concept of Maxwell’s demon (Section 14.7). He applied for, but did not get, the position of Principal of St Andrews’ University, but in 1871 was appointed to the newlyestablished Professorship of Experimental Physics in Cambridge (after William Thomson and Hermann Helmholtz both turned the job down). There he supervised the building of the Cavendish Laboratory and wrote his celebrated treatise on ‘Electricity and Magnetism’ (1873) where his four electromagnetic equations (‘Maxwell’s equations’) first appear. In 1877 he was diagnosed with abdominal cancer and died in Cambridge in 1879. <br> In his short life Maxwell had been one of the most prolific, inspirational and creative scientists that has ever lived. His work has had far-reaching implications in much of physics, not just in thermodynamics. He had also lived a devout and contemplative life in which he had been free of pride, selfishness and ego, always generous and courteous to everyone.</p>
