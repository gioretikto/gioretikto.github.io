<h1>Josiah Willard Gibbs</h1>

<p>Josiah Willard Gibbs was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on February 11, 1839, and died there in 1903. He received his Ph.D. in engineering from Yale University in 1863, the second doctorate in science and the first in engineering awarded in the United States. He stayed on at Yale, for years without salary, and remained there for the rest of his life. In 1878, Gibbs published a long, original treatise on thermodynamics titled "On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances" in the Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Sciences. In addition to introducing the concept of chemical potential, Gibbs introduced what is now called the <a href="../chemistry/thermodynamics/phase_rule.html">Gibbs phase rule</a>, which relates the number of components (C) and the number of phases (P) in a system to the number of degrees of freedom (F, the number of variables such as temperature and pressure that can be varied independently) by the equation F = C - 2 - P. Between its austere writing style and the obscurity of the journal in which it was published, however, this important work was not as widely appreciated as it deserved. Fortunately, Gibbs sent copies to a number of prominent European scientists. Maxwell and van der Waals immediately appreciated the signifance of the work and made it known in Europe. Eventually, Gibbs received the recognition that was his due, and Yale finally offered him a salaried position in 1880. Gibbs was an unassuming, modest person, living in New Haven in his family home his en tire life.</p>

<p>He reflected for years before publishing his conclusions, and then did so in precisely expressed papers in an obscure journal (<i>The Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and
Sciences</i>). He needed interpreters before the power of his work was recognized and before it could be applied to industrial processes. </p>

<p>The dot product notation was first introduced by Gibbs in a pamphlet distributed to his students at Yale University in the 1880s. The product was originally written on the baseline, rather than centered as today, and was referred to as the <b>direct product</b>. Gibbsâ€™s pamphlet was eventually incorporated into a book entitled Vector Analysis that was published in 1901 and coauthored with one of his students. Gibbs made major contributions to the fields of thermodynamics and electromagnetic theory and is generally regarded as the greatest American physicist of the nineteenth century.</p>
