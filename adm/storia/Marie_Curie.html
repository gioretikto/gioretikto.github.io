<h1>Marya Skłodowska Curie</h1>

<p>Curie was born Marya Skłodowska in 1867 in Warsaw. Her family struggled under a repressive Tsarist regime, which was trying to stamp out vestiges of Polish culture. As a teenager, Curie made a pact with her sister Bronya: she would support Bronya while she was in medical school in Paris, and then Bronya would pay Curie’s way. From the age of 17, for six years, Curie worked as a governess and tutor, while attempting to study in her spare time. Finally, at age 24, she enrolled at the Sorbonne University. She could not attend the University of Warsaw, as her brother had: the Russian government prohibited women from attending university anywhere in its empire. In Paris, she felt unprepared but exhilarated. Curie decided to do her thesis on radiation, recently discovered in uranium by Henri Becquerel. She found that an ore containing uranium was far more radioactive than could be explained by its uranium content. This led her and her husband, Pierre, to the discovery of a new element that was 400 times more radioactive than uranium. In 1898 it was added to the Periodic Table as <a href="../chemistry/general/Po.html">polonium</a>, named after Curie’s birth country. The  designation  of  polonium had provocative significance since as a state Poland had disappeared in 1795, being parceled out between Prussia, Russia  and the Austrian Empire. <br> For her research in “radiation phenomena,” Curie became, in 1903, the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize. French academics originally proposed only her husband and Henri Becquerel, but Pierre Curie insisted that his wife share the honour.</p>

<p>It was far from easy to track down the new radioactive elements. Pitchblende is a highly complex mineral, made of combinations of up to 30 different elements. To isolate the unknown substances, of which only tiny amounts were present, the Curies were the first to use a new method of chemical analysis. They employed various standard (but sometimes demanding) chemical procedures to separate the different substances in pitchblende. For example, a particular element might dissolve in an acid, which they could pour off, leaving other elements behind in a sludge at the bottom of the pot. After the materials were separated into different types of compounds, the Curies used radiation measurements to trace the minute amount of unknown, radioactive element among the fractions that resulted.</p>

<p>After Pierre Curie's death, Marie Curie isolated pure radium. <br> A second publication, in December 1898, explained their discovery in the barium fraction of another new element, which they named "<a href="Ra.html">radium</a>" from the Latin word for ray. The Curies were close to reaching one of the highest goals that a scientist of the time could hope to achieve--placing new elements in the Periodic Table. While the chemical properties of the two new elements were completely dissimilar, they both had strong radioactivity. </p>

<p>Pierre Curie was the love of Curie’s life and her partner in science. They met in 1894 when Marie Curie worked in Pierre Curie’s lab; they were married the following year. The couple had two daughters, Irène and Eve, and a few years after they married, Pierre Curie abandoned his own research to join his wife’s study of radioactivity. The Curies’ affair of the heart and mind ended tragically not long after Eve was born. In 1906, Pierre Curie was run over by a horse and carriage and killed.</p>

<p>During World War I, Curie promoted the use of X-rays; she developed radiological cars - which later became known as “petites Curies” - to allow battlefield surgeons to X-ray wounded soldiers and operate more accurately.</p>

<p>The Curies did not fully appreciate the danger of the radioactive materials they handled. Pierre Curie gave himself a lesion when he purposely exposed his arm to radium. Worse, however, was working for years in a poorly ventilated shed, isolating radium salts from tons of pitchblende ore.</p>

<p>Both Curies were constantly ill from radiation sickness, and Marie Curie’s death from aplastic anemia in 1934, at age 66, was likely caused by radiation exposure. A few of her books and papers are still so radioactive that they are stored in lead boxes. It seems fitting that Curie left a scientific legacy that is literally untouchable.</p>
