<h1>Hermann von Helmholtz</h1>

<p><b>Hermann von Helmholtz</b> was born in Potsdam, Germany, on August 31, 1821, and died in 1894. Although he wanted to study physics, his family could not afford to send him to the University, so he studied medicine in Berlin because he could obtain state financial aid. He was, however, required to repay his stipend by service as a surgeon in the army for eight years. He was later appointed professor at the University of Konigsberg, and he also held positions at Bonn, Heidelberg, and Berlin. In 1885, in recognition of his position as the foremost scientist in Germany, he was appointed president of the newly founded Physico-Technical Institute in Berlin, an institution devoted to purely scientific research. Helmholtz was one of the greatest scientists of the 19th century, making important discoveries in physiology, optics, acoustics, electromagnetic theory, and thermodynamics. His work in physiology showed that physiological phenomena are based upon the laws of physics and not on some vague "vital force." In thermodynamics, he derived the equation now known as the <a href="../chemistry/thermodynamics/Gibbs_Helmholtz.html">Gibbs-Helmholtz equation</a>, which we will discuss in this chapter. Helmholtz was always generous with his students and other scientists, but unfortunately he was a barely intelligible lecturer, even to the likes of <a href="max_planck.html">Planck</a>, who was a student in several of his classes. Helmholtz's great influence in German science was recognized by the Kaiser, who bestowed him with the title "von."</p>
