<h1>Rudolf Clausius</h1>

<p>Rudolf Clausius was born in Koslin, Prussia (now Koszalin, Poland), on January 2, 1822,and died in 1888. Although Clausius was initially attracted to history, he eventually received his Ph.D. in mathematical physics from the University of Halle in 1847. He held a position for several years at the University of Zurich but returned to Germany and in 1871 settled at the University of Bonn, where he remained for the rest of his life. Clausius is credited with creating the early foundations of thermodynamics. In 1850, he published his first great paper on the theory of heat, in which he rejected the then-current caloric theory and argued that the energy of a system is a thermodynamic state function. In 1865, he published his second landmark paper, in which he introduced another new thermodynamic state function, which he called entropy, and expressed the Second Law of Thermodynamics in terms of the entropy. Clausius also studied the kinetic theory of gases and made important contributions to it. He was chauvinistic and strongly defended German achievements against what he considered the infringements of others. Most of Clausius' work was done before 1870 because of two events in his life. In 1870, he was wounded while serving in an ambulance corps in the Franco-Prussian War and suffered life-long pain from his injury. More tragically, his wife died in childbirth, and he assumed the responsibility of raising six young children.</p>
