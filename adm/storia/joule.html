<h1>James Prescott Joule</h1>

<p><b>James Prescott Joule</b> was born in Salford, near Manchester, England, on December 24, 1818, and died in 1889. He and his elder brother were tutored at home by John Dalton, then in his 70s. Joule's father was a wealthy brewer, which allowed Joule freedom from having to seek employment. Joule conducted his pioneering experiments in laboratories he built at his own expense in his home or in his father's brewery. From 1837 to 1847, he carried out a series of experiments that led to the general law of energy conservation and to the mechanical equivalent of heat. Joule announced all his measurements in a public lecture at St. Ann's Church in Manchester, England and, because his earlier reports had been rejected by the British Association, later had his lecture published in the Manchester Courier, a newspaper for which his brother wrote musical critiques. In 1847, he presented his results to the British Association meeting in Oxford, where the 22-year-old William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) immediately appreciated the importance of Joule's work. Thomson later asked Joule to carry out experiments on the expansion of gases. This work led to the discovery of the Joule-Thomson effect, which demonstrated that a nonideal gas cools when undergoing a free expansion. Joule was elected to the Royal Society in 1850. Later in life, he suffered severe financial losses, and in 1878 friends obtained a pension for him from the government. The SI unit of energy is named in his honor.</p>
