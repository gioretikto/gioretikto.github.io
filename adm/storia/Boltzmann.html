<h1>Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906)</h1>

<p>Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906) made major contributions to the applications of probability to thermal physics. He worked out much of the kinetic theory of gases independently of Maxwell, and together they share the credit for the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. Boltzmann was very much in awe of Maxwell all his life, and was one of the first to see the significance of Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism. “Was it a god who wrote these lines?” was Ludwig Boltzmann mann’s comment (quoting Goethe) on Maxwell’s work. Boltzmann’s great insight was to recognize the statistical connection between thermodynamic entropy and the number of microstates, and through a series of technical papers was able to put the subject of statistical mechanics on a firm footing (his work was, independently, substantially extended by
the American physicist Gibbs). Boltzmann was able to show that the second law of thermodynamics could be derived from the principles of classical mechanics, although the fact that classical mechanics makes no distinction between the direction of time meant that he had to smuggle in some assumptions that mired his approach in some controversy. However, his derivation of what is known as the Boltzmann transport equation, which extends the ideas of the kinetic theory of gases, led to important developments in the electron transport theory of metals and in plasma physics. Boltzmann also showed how to derive from the
principles of thermodynamics the empirical law discovered by his teacher, Josef Stefan, which stated that the total radiation from a hot body was proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. <br> Boltzmann was born in Vienna and did his doctorate in the kinetic theory of gases at the University of Vienna under the supervision of Stefan. His subsequent career took him to Graz, Heidelberg,
Berlin, then Vienna again, back to Graz, then Vienna, Leipzig, and finally back to Vienna. His own temperament was in accord with this physical restlessness and lack of stability. The moving around was
also partly due to his difficult relationships with various other physicists, particularly Ernst Mach, who was appointed to a chair in Vienna (which occasioned Boltzmann’s move to Leipzig in 1900), and Wilhelm
Ostwald (whose opposition in Leipzig, together with Mach’s retirement in 1901, motivated Boltzmann’s return to Vienna in 1902, although not before Boltzmann had attempted suicide). The notions of irreversibility inherent in thermodynamics led to some controversial implications, particularly to a Universe based on Newtonian mechanics which are reversible in time. Boltzmann’s approach used probability to understand how the behaviour of atoms determined the properties of matter. Ostwald, a physical chemist, who had himself recognized the importance of Gibbs’ work (see Chapters 16, 20 and 22) to the extent that he had translated Gibbs’ papers into German, was nevertheless a vigorous opponent of theories that involved what he saw as unmeasurable quantities. Ostwald was one of the last opponents of atomism, and became a dedicated opponent of Boltzmann. Ostwald himself was finally convinced of the validity of atoms nearly a decade after Boltzmann’s death, by which time Ostwald had been awarded a Nobel Prize, in 1909, for his work on catalysis. Boltzmann died just before his atomistic viewpoint became obviously vindicated and universally accepted. Boltzmann had suffered from depression and mood swings throughout his life. On holiday in in the  small village of Duino, on the border of the Astro-Hungarian Empire (today Italy) in 1906, Ludwig Boltzmann hanged himself while his wife and daughter were swimming. His famous equation relating entropy <i>S</i> with number of microstates <i>W</i> (or Ω) is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>S</i> = <i>k</i> log <i>W</i></p>

<p>and is engraved on his tombstone in Vienna. The constant <i>k</i> is called the Boltzmann constant, and is usually written as <i>k<sub>B</sub></i>.</p>
