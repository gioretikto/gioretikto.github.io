<h1>Penicillin</h1>

<p>The credit for the discovery of first ‘wonder drug’, penicillin in 1929 goes to Sir Alexander Fleming of England, a Scottish physician and bacteriologist. The discovery of penicillin is a fascinating and fortunate accident. Fleming had been actually interested in searching something that would kill pathogens ever since working on wound infections during the First World
War (1914-1918), he worked in an army hospital in France. One day in September, 1928 upon his return from a week's vacation, Fleming observed that a plate of Staphylococcus aureus had become contaminated with a green mold <i>Penicillium notatum</i> which had accidentally fallen in plate. Observing this plate, Fleming noted that the colonies of Staphylococcus bacterium were evidently being destroyed by the nearby <i>Penicillium</i> colonies. Rather than discarding the contaminated plate, he speculated that the mold was producing a diffusible substance that inhibited the bacterial growth. Fleming isolated and subcultured the mold for further study. He extracted from the fungus a compound which he called penicillin, after the name of the producer organism <i>Penicillium notatum</i>, that could destroy several pathogenic bacteria. Thus, <b>Sir Alexander Fleming in 1929</b> discovered the first antibiotic (Gr. Anti =against + bios = life, the microbial products that can kill susceptible microorganisms and inhibit their growth) penicillin.</p>

<p>Fleming’s monumental work went practically unnoticed until 1940 when Sir Howard W. Florey, and E.B. Chain, at Oxford University, developed methods for industrial productions of penicillin in England. Not only they determined its value as a therapeutic agent during clinical trials conducted in 1941, they were also responsible for placing it before the American Medical World and for gaining the interest of American industry. The commercial production of penicillin in the USA began in 1941. Fleming, Florey and Chain shared the Nobel Prize in 1945 for the discovery and production of penicillin. Penicillium notatum has been replaced with Penicillium chrysogenum for the commercial production of penicillin and the current strain of this species modified through mutation, yields 85,000 units/ml of the medium (the original mold P. chrysogenum synthesized 60 units/ml).</p>

<p>During World War II, the demand for chemotherapeutic agents for treating wound infections led to the development of a production process for penicillin and the beginning of the era of antibiotic research. 100.000 uits of penicillin were painstakingly prepared in time to support the D-Day invasion.</p>

<p>S.A. Waksman at the ’utgers University, USA discovered another antibiotic, streptomycin, produced by two strains of actinomycete Streptomyces griseus in 1944. This antibiotic was the result of patient screening of nearly 10,000 cultures isolated from soils, composts and other natural substances that harbour large numbers of organisms capable of producing antibiotic substances. Waksman received the Nobel prize in 1952 for his discovery of streptomycin used in the treatment of tuberculosis, a bacterial disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, that had been discovered by Robert Koch in 1882.</p>

<p>By 1950, three other microorganisms were identified that produced antibiotics, such as Chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin) from Streptomyces venezuelae by Dr. Paul R. Burkholder in 1947; Aureomycin from Streptomyces aureofaciens by Dr. B.M. Dugger in 1948; and Terramycin from Streptomyces rimosus by Finlay, Hobby and collaborators in 1950.</p>

<p>Antibiotic production continues to be the most important area of industrial microbiology. Intensive screening programmes in all industrial countries continue to increase the number of described antibiotics - 513 antibiotics were known in 1961, 4076 in 1972, 7650 in 1985 and currently there are over 8000 antibiotics known. Of these only a few are being used as chemo-
therapeutic agents. Most of the clinically important antibiotics were discovered between 1929 and 1963 (Table 1.3). The most effective agents were isolated from the molds (Penicillium and Cephalosporium) and from members of the bacterial genera Streptomyces and Bacillus. All these organisms are common contaminants in the soil and air.</p>
