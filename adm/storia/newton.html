<h1>Sir Isaac Newton</h1>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton (1643â€“1727) is arguably the greatest scientific genius of all time. His father was completely uneducated and Isaac himself had no contact with advanced mathematics before the age of twenty. However, by the age of twenty seven, he had been appointed to the Lucasian chair at Cambridge and was one of the foremost scientists in Europe. His greatest achievements were his discovery of the calculus, his laws of motion, and his theory of universal gravitation. On the urging of Halley (the Astronomer Royal), Newton wrote up an account of his new physics and its application to astronomy. <i>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</i> was published in 1687 and is generally recognised as the greatest scientific book ever written.</p>
