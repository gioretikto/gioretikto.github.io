<h1>Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855)</h1>

<p>Carl Friedrich Gauss was born in Brunswick, Germany, on April 30, 1777. He is regarded as the greatest mathematician of the 19th
century and has been called the Prince of Mathematics. Part of Gauss’s greatness is due to the fact that his interest spanned all mathematics known in his time. Since then, the volume of knowledge in mathematics has become so large that no one person could ever hope to master the whole field. In this sense, he may have been the last complete mathematician. The world was almost deprived of Gauss’s genius when, as a child, he fell into an overflowing canal near his home. It is said that he surely would have drowned had he not been rescued by a passerby. His mathematical genius became evident early in his life. He often said that he could reckon before he could talk. In school, his precocity attracted the attention of the Duke of Brunswick. The Duke decided to finance the education of the young prodigy and granted him a fixed pension so that he could devote himself to work without financial considerations.
Gauss made some of the greatest contributions to mathematics when he was a young man. He developed the method of least squares while preparing for university studies at Collegium Carolinium. Two years later, he solved a 2000-year-old problem by proving that a regular 17-sided polygon can be constructed with only a straightedge and a compass. In his doctoral dissertation, Gauss proved the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a result that had
been accepted without proof for many years. In 1801, at the age of 24, he published the monumental work Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, in which he laid the foundations of the area of mathematics called number theory. Also in 1801, when Gauss turned his attention to astronomy, he accomplished an extraordinary achievement. Using a scanty amount of data, he was able to predict accurately the orbit of the asteroid Ceres. For this achievement, he garnered international acclaim. In 1807, he was appointed director of the astronomical observatory of Göttingen.</p>
