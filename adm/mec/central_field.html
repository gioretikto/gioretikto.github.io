<h1>Motion in a central field</h1>

<p>When we move from one-dimensional problems to three-dimensional problems, the degree of complexity increases enormously. Indeed most three-dimensional problems canno be integrated analytically. There is, however a class of problems which can still be handled moderately easily namely the motion of a particle acted on by a force <i><b>F</b> = F <b>r̂</b></i> which is always directed towards (or away from) a fixed point, the <b>force center</b>. This is called a <b>central field</b>. The force acting on the particle is <i><b>F</b> = -∂V(<b>r</b>)/∂r</i>; for such problems the <b>torque</b> <b>r x F</b> on the particle about the force center is zero</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i><b>N</b> = <b>r</b> × <b>F</b> = F(r)(<b>r̂</b> × <b>r̂</b>) = 0,</i></p>
</div>

<p>and the <b>angular momentum</b>, <b>L</b> = <b>r</b> x (m<b>v</b>)</i> is constant. The motion thus lies in a plane <i><b>L ⋅ r</b> = 0</i> which is perpendicular to <b>L</b> and which passes through the force center, the <b>orbital plane</b>. Further the motion is such that the magnitude <i>L</i> of the angular momentum about the force center is constant.</p>

<p>The angular momentum of a single particle is <i><b>l</b> = <b>r</b> x <b>p</b></i>. Since <i><b>L</b></i> is perpdendicular to <i><b>r</b></i>, the constancy of <i><b>L</b></i> shows that, thoughout the motion, the radius vector of the particle lies in the plane perpdendicular to <i><b>L</b></i>.</p>

<p>It is convenient to introduce polar coordinates <i>r</i> and <i>&theta;</i> in the orbital plane, with the force center the pole. We can write the Lagrangian as:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>L = 1/2 m(ṙ<sup>2</sup> + r<sup>2</sup> θ̇<sup>2</sup>) - V(r)</i></p>
</div>

<p>This function does not involve the coordinate &theta; explicitly. Any generalised co-ordinate <i>q<sub>i</sub></i> which does not appear explicitly in the Lagrangian is said to be <b>cyclic</b>. For such a co-ordinate we have, by Lagrange's equation,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>(d/dt) ∂L/q̇<sub>i</sub> - ∂L/q<sub>i</sub> = 0</i></p>
</div>

<p>reduces, for a cyclic coordinate, to</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>(d/dt) ∂L/q̇<sub>i</sub> = 0</i></p>
</div>

<p>so that the corresponding generalised momentum <i>p<sub>i</sub> = ∂L/q̇<sub>i</sub></i> is an integral of the motion. This leads to a considerable simplification of the problem of integrating the equations of motion when there are cyclic coordinates. The corresponding canonical momentum is the angular momentum of the system</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>p<sub>&theta;</sub> = ∂L/∂θ̇  = mr<sup>2</sup>θ̇</i></p>
</div>

<p>One of the two equations of motion is then simply</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>ṗ<sub>&theta;</sub> = (d/dt) mr<sup>2</sup>θ̇  = 0</i>
<span>(3.7)</span></p>
</div>

<p>with the immediate integral</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>mr<sup>2</sup>θ̇  = l</i>
<span>(3.8)</span></p>
</div>

<p>the quantity L = distance r from origin x component mrθ̇  of m<b>v</b> perpendicular to <b>r</b> is the magnitude of the angular momentum, so this simply confirms what we already know. Where <i>l</i> is the constant magnitude of the angular momentum. From (3.7) it also follows that</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>d/dt (1/2 r<sup>2</sup>θ̇) = 0</i></p>
</div>

<p>This factor is inserted because 1/2 r<sup>2</sup>θ̇  is the <i>areal velocity</i>. The areal law (cf. <i>Kepler’s second law</i>) is a consequence of conservation of angular momentum. We show this as follows. Let <i>A</i> be the areal velocity, that is, the area swept out by the radius vector <i><b>r</b>(t)</i> per unit time. The area <i>dA</i> swept out by the radius vector <i>r</i> during the infinitesimal time interval <i>dt</i> is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>dA = 1/2 r (r d&theta;)</i></p>
</div>

<p>and hence</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>dA/dt = 1/2 r<sup>2</sup> d&theta;/dt</i></p>
</div>

<p>The conservation of angular momentum is thus equivalent to saying the areal velocity is constant. It should be emphasized however that the conservation of the areal velocity is a general propery of central force motion and is not restricted to an inveerse-square law of force.</p>

<p>The remeaining Lagrange equation, for the coordinate <i>r</i>, is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>d/dt (mṙ)- mrθ̇<sup>2</sup> + ∂V/∂r = 0</i></p>
</div>

<p>Designating the value of the force along <i><b>r</b></i>, -∂V/∂r, by <i>f(r)</i> the equation can be rewritten as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>mr̈ - mrθ̇<sup>2</sup> = f(r)</i></p>
</div>

<p>The fact that l is constant can be used to eliminate θ̇ )l/(mr<sup>2</sup>) from the radial equation of motion. If further the central force is conservative so that <i><b>F</b> = -∂V/∂r</i>, we obtain a second-order differential equation involving <i>r</i> only:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>mr̈ - l<sup>2</sup>/(mr<sup>3</sup>) = f(r)</i></p>
</div>

<h2>Conservation of Energy</h2>

<p>To find the details of the orbit we must look more closely at the radial equation. If both sides of Equation (3.14) are multiplied by <i>ṙ</i> the left side becomes:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>mr̈ṙ = d/dt(V + l<sup>2</sup>/(2mr<sup>2</sup>)</i></p>
</div>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>d/dt(1/2 mṙ) = -d/dt(V + l<sup>2</sup>/(2mr<sup>2</sup>)</i>
<span>(3.14)</span></p>
</div>

<p>In other words,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>1/2 mṙ<sup>2</sup> + V + l<sup>2</sup>/(2mr<sup>2</sup>)= const</i></p>
</div>

<p>This result is, in fact, just conservation of energy: If we replace <i>l</i> by <i>mr<sup>2</sup>θ̇</i>, we see that</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>1/2 mṙ<sup>2</sup> + V<sub>eff</sub>(r) = 1/2 mṙ<sup>2</sup> + 1/2 mr<sup>2</sup>θ̇ <sup>2</sup> + V(r) = E</i></p>
</div>

<h2>Kepler Problem</h2>

<p>In this section we study the motion under the action of the Newtonian potential</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>F</i> = −<i>k</i>/<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = -dV/dr &emsp; where &emsp; V = -k/r</i></p>
</div>

<p>with <i>k</i> positive constant.</p>

<p>The energy and angular momentum equations are</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>E = mṙ<sup>2</sup> + l<sup>2</sup>/(2mr<sup>2</sup>) - k/r &emsp; and &emsp; l = mr<sup>2</sup>θ̇</i></p>
</div>

<p>which on integration to <i>r</i> and &theta; as functions of time. Rather than doing these integrations immediately, however, it is more useful to obtain <b><i>r</i> as a function of &theta;</b>; that is, to obtain the equation which describes the shape of the <b>orbit</b>.</p>

<p>Kepler’s first law, which was the most revolutionary at the time (when circular orbits were considered divine), is that all planets execute elliptical orbits. This fact can be derived by noting that</p>
