<h1>Dynamics of Uniform Circular Motion</h1>

<p>As explained when studying the kinematics of circular motion, the velocity vector and momentum vector of the particle change continuosly due to the change in the direction. Now, accordind to Newton's second law of motion, the momentum vector of particle cannot change unless it is acted upon by a constant force. Thus, an external force must continuosly act upon a particle moving in a circle so as to cause a change in its momentum and hence direction of motion. Now, the particle due to its inertia, tends to move along the tangent to the circle at every point with constant speed. Therefore, the force must always act at right angles to the direction of motion at every point, because if it acted in any other direction, it would have a component along the direction of motion and thus change the speed. Since the radius of a circle is always perpendicular to the tangent at any point, the external force acts along the radius of the circle at every point, i.e., always directed towards the centre of the circle along which the body moves. Such a force is called <i>centripetal force</i>.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>|&Sigma;<i><b>F</b></i>| = <i>mv</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>R</i></p>
</div>

The corresponding centripetal force is obtained by multiplying the centripetal acceleration, <i>a</i> = <i>mv</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>R</i> by the mass of the object, i.e.,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>F<sub>c</sub></i> = <i>mv</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>r</i></p>
</div>

<p>and it points towards the center O.</p>

<p><b>Example 1</b>. When a car moves at a steady speed around an ubbanked curve, the centripetal force keeping the car on the curve comes from the static friction between the road and the tires. It is static rather than kinetic friction, because the tires are not slipping with respect to the radial direction. If the static frictional force is insufficient, given the speed and the radius of the turn, the car will skid the road. <br>At what maximum spped, <i>v<sub>m</sub></i> can a car safely negotiate a horizontal ubbanked turn (radius = 150 m) in dry weather (&mu;<sub>s</sub> = 1.2)</p>

<p><b>Reasoning</b>. The speed <i>v</i> at which teh car of mass <i>m</i> can negotiate a turn of radius <i>R</i> is related to the centripetal force <i>F<sub>c</sub></i>. Static friction provides the centripetal force and can provide a maximum force <i>F<sub>s</sub><sup>MAX</sup></i> = <i>&mu;<sub>s</sub> F<sub>N</sub></i>. <br>The fact that the car does not accelerate in the vertical direction tells us that the normal force balances the car's weight <i>mg</i>, or</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>F<sub>N</sub></i> = <i>mg</i></p>
</div>

<p>Thus we will use the fact that <i>F<sub>c</sub></i> = <i>F<sub>s</sub><sup>MAX</sup></i> to obtain the maximum speed. </p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>mv</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>R</i> = <i>&mu;<sub>s</sub>F<sub>N</sub></i> = <i>&mu;<sub>s</sub>mg</i></p>
</div>

<p>So the speed <i>v</i> is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>v<sub>m</sub> = √<i>&mu;<sub>s</sub>gR</i></p>
</div>

<p>Replacing back data we obtain</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>v<sub>m</sub> = √[(1.2)(9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>) (150 m)] = 42 m/s&emsp;■</p>
</div>
