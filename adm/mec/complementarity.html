<h1>Complementarity</h1>

<p>In quantum mechanics, a quantity which can be observed - an <i>observable</i> - is always represented by an operator "operating" on the wave function &Psi;. The operation of observation which modifies the state of the system is, thus, represented by an operator which modifies the wave function. Consequently, the result of two successive applications of two operators <i><b>A</b></i> and <i><b>B</b></i>, may depend on the order in which they are applied because each of the observations (say that of the momentum followed by that of the position and <i>vice versa</i>) may modify the state of the system in different ways. Thus, we see that</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i><b>AB</b></i> &ne; <i><b>BA</b></i></p>
</div>

<p>and the difference</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>[<i><b>A,B</b></i>] = <i><b>BA</b></i> − <i><b>BA</b></i></p>
</div>

<p>is defined as the <i>commutator</i> of the operators <i><b>A,B</b><i>, applied in the order indicated in the equation. When</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>[<i><b>A,B</b></i>] = 0</p>
</div>

<p>the operators are said to commute; otherwise, we say they do not commute. Observables whose operators do not commute are said to be <i>complementary</i>. As Heisenberg discovered position and linear momentum are complementary observables. The relation says we cannot measure both observables <i>simultaneously</i> with arbitrary precision. </p>

<p>If the result of operating on a function <i>f</i> is the function <i>f</i> itself, except for a constant of proportionality <i>a</i>, the function <i>f</i> is called a <i>characteristic</i> or <i>eigenfunction</i> of the operator. Hence, if</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i><b>A</b> f</i> = <i>af</i></p>
</div>

<p><i>f</i> is an eigenfunction of the operator <i><b>A</b></i> and <i>a</i> is its associated <i>eigenvalue</i>. The eigenfunctions of an operator constitute a speciale set of cunction whose form remains unaltered when the operator is applied to each of them except, as stated, for a possible constant factor. Naturally, the solution of the previous equation need not be unique, and for this reason we speak of a set of eigenfunctions <i>f<sub>n</sub></ui> and not of a single eigenfunction. <br>As an example, we consider</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i><b>A</b> ≡ -<i>i</i>∂/∂<i>x</i></p>
</div>

<p>The eigenfunctions <i>f<sub>n</sub></I> must be determined from the differential equation.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>i</i>-∂<i>f<sub>n</sub></i>/∂<i>x</i> = <i>a<sub>n</sub>f<sub>n</sub></i></p>
</div>

<p>whose general solution is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>f<sub>n</sub></i> (<i>x</i>) = e<sup>ia<sub>n</sub>x</sup></p>
</div>

<p>as is easily verified by substitution. Explicitly, we have</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>f<sub>n</sub></i> = cos(a<sub>n</sub>x) + sin(a<sub>n</sub>x)</p>
</div>

<p>Suppose I throw an apple into the air, and you photograph it as it falls to the ground using a camera fitted with a rapid autowind facility. You take a sequence of photographs at fixed time intervals as the apple falls. Each photograph is a record of the position of the apple (its height above the ground, <i>x</i>) at a particular time in its motion. We could analyse the sequence of photographs to find the values of the apple’s position and velocity as a  function of time. A separate measurement of the apple’s mass allows us to calculate the linear momentum, p, (mass times velocity) of the apple in the <i>x</i>-direction. <br> Further suppose that, for some obscure reason, we need to calculate the product of the apple’s position and momentum. I choose to determine the product by multiplying position by momentum. You choose to multiply momentum by position. No matter. We know that for ordinary numbers and their units xp<sub>x</sub>, is equal to p<sub>x</sub>x, and so the results should be the same. In other words, the classical physical quantities <i>x</i> and <i>p<sub>x</sub></i>, commute, and <i>xp</i>, minus <i>px</i> is equal to zero. This might seem trivial, but as the discoveries of quantum theory found in the 1920s, experiment demands that, for quantum particles, it <i>does</i> matter what order you multiply these quantities together, and <i>xp<sub>x</sub></i> is <i>not</i> equal to <i>p<sub>x</sub>x</i>. Clearly, these quantities can no longer be represented by ordinary numbers. Either they are matrices (matrix mechanics), or they are operators (wave mechanics or quantum theory based on vector spaces). In the former case, the rules of matrix multiplication are such that the order of multiplications is important. In the latter case, it is the order in which operations are carried out on a function that can be important. We achieve correspondence between the predictions of quantum theory and the results of experiments if <i>xp<sub>x</sub></i>, minus <i>p<sub>x</sub>x</i> is assumed to be equal to <i>iℏ</i> where <i>i</i> represents the square root of —1 and ℏ is Planck’s constant divided by 2&pi;. This is known as the quantum-mechanical position-momentum <i>commutanon relation</i>. Because Planck’s constant <i>h</i> is very small, measurements made on macroscopic objects such as apples will never reveal behaviour that contradicts our ‘common-sense’ classical presumption that <i>xp<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>p<sub>x</sub>x</i> commute. However, for microscopic objects like electrons, the magnitude of Planck’s constant becomes extremely significant. The above considerations demonstrate, once again, that classical mechanics can be recovered from quantum mechanics in the limit that <i>h</i> is approximated to zero. </p>
