<h1>Torque</h1>

<p>Forces cause accelerations; <i>torques</i> cause angular accelerations. There is a definite relationship, however, between the two concepts.<br> Figure 8.1 depicts an overhead view of a door hinged at point <i>O</i>. From this viewpoint, the door is free to rotate around an axis perpendicular to the page and passing through <i>O</i>. If a force <b><i>F</i></b> is applied to the door, there are three factors that determine the effectiveness of the force in opening the door; the magnitude of the force, the position of application of the force, and the angle at which it is applied. For simplicity, we restrict our discussion to position and force vectors lying in a plane. When the applied force <b><i>F</i></b> is perpendicular to the outer edge of the door, as in Figure 8.1, the door rotates counterclockwise with constant angular acceleration. The same perpendicular force applied at a point nearer the hinge results in a smaller angular acceleration. A doorknob is located as far as possible from the door’s hinge line for a good rea­­son. If you want to open a heavy door, you must certainly apply a force, but that is not enough. Where you apply that force and in what direction you push are also important. If you apply your force nearer to the hinge line than the knob, or at any angle other than 90° to the plane of the door, you must use a greater force than if you apply the force at the knob and perpendicular to the door’s plane. In general, a larger radial distance <i>r</i> between the applied force and the axis of rotation results in a larger angular acceleration. Similarly, a larger applied force will also result in a larger angular acceleration.</p>

<p>The torque of a force <b><i>F</i></b> ­applied at point <i>P</i>, whose position relative to <i>O</i> is defined by a position vector <b><i>r</i></b> is defined as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i><b>&tau;</b></i> = <i><b>r</b></i> x <i><b>F</b></i></p>
</div>

<p>Teh magnitude of this vector product is <i>&tau;</i> = <i>rF</i> sin <i>&theta;</i> and the direction is perpendicular to the plane that contains both <i><b>r</b></i> and <i><b>F</b></i> in accordance with the right-hand rule. <br>Under these conditions, an object can rotate around the chosen axis in one of two directions. By convention, counterclockwise is taken to be the positive direction, clockwise the negative direction. When an applied force causes an object to rotate counterclockwise, the torque on the object is positive. When the force causes the object to rotate clockwise, the torque on the object is negative. When two or more torques act on an object at rest, the torques are added. If the net torque isn’t zero, the object starts rotating at an ever-increasing rate. If the net torque is zero, the object’s rate of rotation doesn’t change. These considerations lead to the rotational analog of the first law: <b>the rate of rotation of an object doesn’t change, unless the object is acted on by a net torque</b>.</p>
