<h1>The Equation of the Orbit</h1>

<p>The radial equation (8.29) determines r a s a function of t , but for many purposes we would like to know <i>r</i> as a function of <i>t</i>. For example, the function <i>r = r(&theta;)</i> will tell us the shape of the orbit more directly. Thus we would like to rewrite the radial equation as a differential equation for <i>r</i> in terms of &theta;. There are two tricks for doing this, but let me first write the radial equation in terms of forces</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>mr̈ =  F(r) + l<sup>2</sup>/(2mr<sup>2</sup>)</i></p>
</div>

<p>where F(r) is the actual central force, F = -dV/dr, and the second term is the centrifugal force.</p>

<p>In this section we study the motion under the action of the Newtonian potential</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>F =-k/r<sup>2</sup> = -dV/dr &emsp; where &emsp; V = -k/r</i></p>
</div>

<p>with <i>k</i> positive constant.</p>

<p>The energy and angular momentum equations are</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>E = mṙ<sup>2</sup> + l<sup>2</sup>/(2mr<sup>2</sup>) - k/r &emsp; and &emsp; l = mr<sup>2</sup>θ̇</i></p>
</div>

<p>which on integration to <i>r</i> and &theta; as functions of time. Rather than doing these integrations immediately, however, it is more useful to obtain <b><i>r</i> as a function of &theta;</b>; that is, to obtain the equation which describes the shape of the <b>orbit</b>.</p>

<p>Kepler’s first law, which was the most revolutionary at the time (when circular orbits were considered divine), is that all planets execute elliptical orbits. This fact can be derived by noting that</p>
