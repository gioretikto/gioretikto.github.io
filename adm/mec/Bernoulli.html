<h1>Bernoulli's principle</h1>

<p>In general, kinetic energy is not conserved in fluid flow, even when no external forces act on the fluid. Frictional forces between adjacent regions of fluid moving with slightly different velocities transform kinetic energy into thermal energy, in somewhat the same way that friction dissipates kinetic energy when solid surfaces slide by one another. This is how an agitated fluid comes to rest. Common experience suggest that different fluids dissipate energy at very differe rates. <i>Viscosity</i> is the measure of the strenght of dissipative forces in a liquid. When viscosity can be ignored, a flow is termed <b>inviscid</b> or <b>ideal</b>. In many aspects of the study of wind and water power, air and water may be regarded as ideal. Under these circumstances, conservation of energyu provides a powerful relation, known as <i>Bernoulli's principle</i> or <i>Bernoulli's equation</i>, that relates the static pressure and the kinetic and potential energy along any streamline in the fluid.</p>

<p>Suppose air is being pumped down a smooth round tube, which has a constant diameter except for a section in the middle where the tube narrows down to half the diameter, then widens out again. Assume all the changes in diameter take place smoothly, and the air flows steadily down the tube, with no eddies or turbulence.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>: where in the tube do you expect the pressure to be greatest?</p>

<p>Most people asked this for the first time predict that the pressure will be greatest in the narrow portion of the tube.  But in fact, if we actually do the experiment, by putting pressure gauges at various points along the tube, we find, counter intuitively, that the <i>air pressure is lowest where the air is moving fastesy</i>!</p>

<h3 id="steady">Steady Flow</h3>

<p>If the velocity of fluid particles at any point does not vary with time, the flow is said to be steady. Steady flow is also called streamlines or laminar flow. The velocity at different points may be different. Hence, in the figure</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i><b>v</b></i><sub>1</sub> = constant, <i><b>v</b></i><sub>2</sub> = constant, <i><b>v</b></i><sub>3</sub> = constant &emsp;but&emsp; <i><b>v</b></i><sub>1</sub> &ne; <i><b>v</b></i><sub>2</sub> &ne; <i><b>v</b></i><sub>3</sub>
</div>

<h3>The continuity law</h3>

<p>The continuity law assumes an incompressible flow confined in a duct. The fluid is incompressible, so as much fluid enters the pipe each second as leaves it; this is the proverbial “what goes in must come out.” Airflow is equal to the cross-sectional area multiplied by the particle velocity. Therefore, if the duct narrows, the velocity must increase proportionally to mantain constant flow. In algebraic form:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>v</i><sub>1</sub><i>A</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>v</i><sub>2</sub><i>A</i><sub>2</sub></p>
</div>

<p>This is the <b>equation of continuity</b> and leads to:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>v</i><sub>1</sub><i>A</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>v</i><sub>2</sub><i>A</i><sub>2</sub></p>
</div>

<p>The flow speed is greater in the thinner part of the pipe.</p>


<h2>The Bernoulli equation</h2>

<p>Bernoulli's equation is the work-energy theorem (conservation of energy) for fluids under a few assumptions:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Assume that the fluid is <i>incompressible</i></p></li>
	<li><p>Ignore the fluid friction, i.e., <b>viscosity</b>.</p></li>
	<li><p>Assume flow is smooth (laminar) and not turbulent.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the derivation of the Bernoulli equation by means of the conservation of energy principle, the work performed by the external pressure forces <i>F</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>F</i><sub>2</sub> on an element of the stream tube is equated to the increase in kinetic- and potential energy. </p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>W</i><sub>net</sub> = &Delta;<i>K</i> + &Delta;<i>U</i></p>
</div>

<p>At the left end, the fluid force <i>F</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>p</i><sub>1</sub><i>A</i><sub>1</sub> acts through the displacement &Delta;<i>x</i> = <i>v</i>&Delta;<i>t</i> and does work <i>W</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>p</i><sub>1</sub><i>A</i><sub>1</sub><i>v</i>&Delta;<i>t</i>, analogously at the right end so the net work is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>W</i><sub>net</sub> = <i>p</i><sub>1</sub><i>A</i><sub>1</sub><i>v</i>&Delta;<i>t</i> − <i>p</i><sub>2</sub><i>A</i><sub>2</sub><i>v</i>&Delta;<i>t</i></p>
</div>

<figure>
<img src="img/Bernoulli.png" alt="Bernoulli effect"/>
<figcaption>The volumes &Delta;<i>V</i> in the two shaded regions are the same &Delta;<i>V</i> = <i>v</i><sub>1</sub><i>A</i><sub>1</sub>&Delta;<i>t</i> = <i>v</i><sub>2</sub><i>A</i><sub>2</sub>&Delta;<i>t</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Owing to the continuity equation for an incompressible fluid <i>v</i><sub>1</sub><i>A</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>v</i><sub>2</sub><i>A</i><sub>2</sub>, we have that &Delta;<i>V</i> = <i>v</i><sub>1</sub><i>A</i><sub>1</sub>&Delta;<i>t</i> = <i>v</i><sub>2</sub><i>A</i><sub>2</sub>&Delta;<i>t</i> is the volume of fluid entering from the left end, and leaving from the right end portion of the tube, in the time interval &Delta;<i>t</i>. The net work can thus be expressed as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>W</i><sub>net</sub> = (<i>p</i><sub>1</sub> − <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>)&Delta;<i>V</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Knowing that in both regions the mass <i>m</i> of the fluid in the stream tube is <i>&rho;</i>&Delta;<i>V</i>, we may write the gain in kinetic energy as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&Delta;<i>E<sub>k</sub></i> = 1/2 ⋅ <i>mv</i><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> − 1/2 ⋅ <i>mv</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></p>
</div>

<p>The gain in potential energy, due to location 2 being at another position in Earth's gravitational field is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&Delta;<i>E<sub>p</sub></i> = <i>&rho;</i>&Delta;<i>Vgy</i><sub>2</sub> − <i>&rho;</i>&Delta;<i>Vgy</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>mg</i>(<i>y</i><sub>2</sub> − <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>)</p>
</div>

<p>From the <a href="work_energy_theorem.html">work-kinetic energy theorem</a>, the change in energy of this chunk is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>(<i>p</i><sub>1</sub> − <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>)&Delta;<i>V</i> = (<i>mg</i><i>y</i><sub>2</sub> + 1/2 ⋅ <i>&rho;</i>&Delta;<i>V</i><i>v</i><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>) − (<i>mg</i><i>y</i><sub>1</sub> + 1/2 ⋅ <i>&rho;</i>&Delta;<i>V</i><i>v</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>) </p>
</div>

<p>which by dividing by &Delta;<i>V</i>, and recalling that <i>&rho;</i> = <i>m</i>/&Delta;<i>V</i>, yields to</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>p</i><sub>1</sub> − <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>&rho;g</i><i>y</i><sub>2</sub> + 1/2 ⋅ <i>&rho;v</i><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> − <i>&rho;g</i><i>y</i><sub>1</sub> − 1/2 ⋅ <i>&rho;v</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></p>
</div>

<p>which can be rearranged to</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>p</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>&rho;g</i><i>y</i><sub>1</sub> + 1/2 ⋅ <i>&rho;v</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> = <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> + <i>&rho;g</i><i>y</i><sub>2</sub> + 1/2 ⋅ <i>&rho;v</i><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>  </p>
</div>

<p>This equation is named after Daniel Bernoulli, who in 1738 derived the equation in this "Hydrodinamica", the first modern monograph on hydrodynamics and applied it to serval problems in fluid flow.</p>

<p>Notice that if the velocity <i>v</i> is null, then Bernoulli's equation is nothing more than <a href="Stevino.html">Stevino's equation</a>.</p>

<h3>Incompressible fluids</h3>

<p>Something is regarded as incompressible if its volume does not change significantly when it is pressurized. Liquids are usually incompressible. Even though gases are compressible, we can still use the Bernoulli equation provided that the velocity of the object moving through the gas, or the velocity of the gas as it flows past an object, is small compared with the velocity of sound through the gas.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Parfume spray</h3>

<ol>
	<li><p>When the plunger is pushed in, the air flows at a high velocity through a nozzle.</p></li>
	<li><p>The flow of air at high velocity creates a region of low pressure above the metal tube. The higher pressure of the atmospheric air acts on the surface of the liquid parfume causing it to rise up the metal tube.</p></li>
	<li><p>The parfume leaves the top of the metal tube through the nozzle as a fine spray.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Bunsen Burner</h3>

<ol>
    <li><p>When the burner is connected to a gas supply, the gas flows at high velocity through a narrow passage in the burner, creating a region of low pressure.</p></li>
    <li><p>The outside air, which is at atmospheric pressure, is drawn in and mixes with the gas.</p></li>
    <li><p>The mixture of gas and air enables the gas to burn completely to produce a clean, hot, and smokeless flame.</p></li>
</ol>
