<h1>Simple Pendulum</h1>

<p>We turn now to a class of simple harmonic oscillators in which the springiness is associated with the gravitational force rather than with the elastic properties of a twisted wire or a compressed or stretched spring.</p>

<p>If an apple swings on a long thread, does it have simple harmonic motion? If so, what is the period <i>T</i>? To answer, we consider a simple pendulum, which consists of a particle of mass <i>m</i> (called the bob of the pendulum) suspended from one end of an unstretchable, massless string of length <i>L</i> that is fixed at the other end, as in Fig. 15-9a. The bob is free to swing back and forth in the plane of the page, to the left and right of a vertical line through the pendulum's pivot point. The forces acting on the bob are the force <b>T</b> from the string and the gravitational force <b>F</b><sub>g</sub>, as shown in Fig. 1, where the string makes an angle (&theta;) with the vertical. We resolve <b>F</b><sub>g</sub> into a radial component <b>F</b><sub>g</sub> cos &theta; and a component <b>F</b><sub>g</sub> sin &theta; that is tangent to the path taken by the bob. This tangential component produces a restoring torque about the pendulum's pivot point because the component always acts opposite the displacement of the bob so as to bring the bob back toward its central location. That location is called the <i>equilibrium position</i> (&theta; = 0) because the pendulum would be at rest there were it not swinging.</p>

<p>For Newton's second law, this force must be equal the product mass times acceleration:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>mL&theta;</i> '' = &minus;<i>mg</i> sin <i>&theta;</i></p>
</div>

<p>that is</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&theta;</i> '' = &minus;<i>g/L</i> sin <i>&theta;</i></p>
</div>

<p>The last equation is the exact equation of motion for the simple pendulum. Because of the presence of the term in sin θ, this second order ODE is <b>non-linear</b> and cannot be solved by using the standard technique for linear ODEs with constant coefficients. If <i>θ</i> is always small then sin θ can be approximated by θ in which case the equation of motion becomes</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&theta;</i> '' = &minus; (<i>g</i>/<i>L</i>) <i>&theta;</i></p>
</div>

<p>This is the <i>linearised</i> equation for the simple pendulum, which holds approximately for oscillations of small amplitude (we used the fact that sin <i>&theta;</i> ≈ <i>&theta;</i>, for small <i>&theta;</i>). Although we do not cover linear oscillations until Chapter 5, many readers will recognise equation (4.7) as the simple harmonic motion equation and will know that the period <i>T</i> of the oscillations is given by <i>T = 2π(L/g)<sup>1/2</sup>, independent of the (small) amplitude. We find that</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&theta;</i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>A</i> cos(<i>&omega;t + &theta;</i><sub>0</sub>)</p>
</div>

<p>where &omega;t + &theta;</i><sub>0</sub> are constants depending on the initial conditions of the problem.</p>

<p>Galileo dedusse l'<b>isocronismo di un pendolo</b>, ovvero il fatto che, per piccoli angoli rispetto alla verticale, la durata di un'oscillazione non dipende dall'ampiezza della stessa.</p>
