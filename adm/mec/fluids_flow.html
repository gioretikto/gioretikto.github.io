<h1>Fluids in Motion</h1>

<p>When a fluid is in motion, its flow can be characterized in one of two ways. The flow is said to be <b>streamline</b>, or <b>laminar</b>, if the fluid particles move along smooth paths in the layers with each layer of sliding smoothly over its neighbor. As the velocity of flow increases, the different layers start interfering in each other's motion due to different inertia and friction at some point and eventually  the laminar flow becomes unstable, vortices start to form, and ultimately the fluid flow becomes turbulent. Hence turbulent flow is one in which different layers collide with one another and cause non-uniformity. When flow is turbulent fluid particle velocity vectors for each point, change rapidly over time, both in magnitude and direciton.</p>

<p><b>Laminar flow</b> is characterized by the smooth flow of the fluid in layers that do not mix. <b>Turbulent flow</b>, or turbulence, is characterized by eddies and swirls that mix layers of fluid together.</p>

<p>if every particle that passes a particular point moves along exactly the same smooth path followed by previous particles passing that point. This path is called a <i>streamline</i>. Different streamlines can’t cross each other under this steady-flow condition, and the streamline at any point coincides with the direction of the velocity of the fluid at that point. <br>In contrast, the flow of a fluid becomes irregular, or <b>turbulent</b>, above a certain velocity or under any conditions that can cause abrupt changes in velocity. Irregular motions of the fluid, called eddy currents, are characteristic in turbulent flow, as shown in Figure 9.26. <br> In discussions of fluid flow, the term <b>viscosity</b> is used for the degree of internal friction in the fluid. This internal friction is associated with the resistance between two adjacent layers of the fluid moving relative to each other. A fluid such as kerosene has a lower viscosity than does crude oil or molasses.</p>

<p>Many features of fluid motion can be understood by considering the behavior of an <b>ideal fluid</b>, which satisfies the following conditions:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p><b>The fluid is nonviscous</b>, which means there is no internal friction force between adjacent layers;</p></li>
	<li><p><b>The fluid is incompressible</b>, which means its density is constant;</p></li>
	<li><p><b>The fluid motion is steady</b>, meaning that the velocity, density, and pressure at each point in the fluid don’t change with time;</p></li>
	<li><p><b>The fluid moves without turbulence</b>. This implies that each element of the fluid has zero angular velocity about its center, so there can’t be any eddy currents present in the moving fluid. A small wheel placed in the fluid would translate but not rotate.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Laminar flow confined to tubes</h2>

<p>The flow of fluids through pipes is of great importance in many cases in nature and technology. In the chemical industry, for example, one often has to deal with liquids that are transported through pipes. Especially when it comes to the correct mixing of reaction partners, the volume flow rate supplied plays a major role. It is of central importance to determine the flow rate on the basis of the pressure generated by the pump and the pipe diameter.</p>

<p>Flows are basically caused by pressure differences which push the fluid from points of higher pressure to points of lower pressure. A permanently decreasing pressure is thus formed along the pipe in the direction of flow. The greater this pressure drop over a certain length of the pipe, the faster the fluid flows through the pipe and the greater the flow rate. The drive for a flow is thus a pressure gradient dp/dx, i.e. the pressure drop per unit length.</p>

<p>In principle, the speed of the flow within the pipe is not constant over the cross-section. There ist friction between the fluid and the pipe, which is why the flow velocity near the wall is lower than in the middle of the pipe. At the wall, the fluid even adheres to the wall due to the adhesive forces. Thus, there is no relative speed between fluid and wall. This is also called no-slip condition. But the individual fluid layers also have friction between each other due to the viscosity of the fluid. This leads to the formation of a certain velocity profile, the course of which is yet to be determined. It should be noted, however, that the flow velocity is maximum in the middle of the pipe and then drops to zero as far as the wall.</p>

<p>What causes flow? The answer, not surprisingly, is pressure difference. In fact, there is a very simple relationship between horizontal flow and pressure. Flow rate <i>Q</i> is in the direction from high to low pressure. The greater the pressure differential between two points, the greater the flow rate. This relationship can be stated as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>Q</i> = (<i>P</i><sub>2</sub> &minus; <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>)/<i>R</i>.</p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li><p><i>P</i><sub>2</sub> and <i>P</i><sub>1</sub> are the pressure at two points;</p></li>
	<li><p><i>R</i> is the resistance to flow.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The resistance R includes everything, except pressure, that affects flow rate. For example, R is greater for a long tube than for a short one. The greater the viscosity of a fluid, the greater the value of R. Turbulence greatly increases R, whereas increasing the diameter of a tube decreases R. The resistance R to laminar flow of an incompressible fluid having viscosity η through a horizontal tube of uniform radius r and length ℓ, such as the one in Figure 5, is given by</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>R = 8&mu;l/&pi;<i>r</i><sup>4</sup></p>
</div>

<p>This equation is called <b>Poiseuille’s law</b> for resistance after the French scientist J. L. Poiseuille (1799–1869), who derived it in an attempt to understand the flow of blood, an often turbulent fluid.</p>

<p>We see that resistance is directly proportional to both fluid viscosity η and the length ℓ of a tube. After all, both of these directly affect the amount of friction encountered—the greater either is, the greater the resistance and the smaller the flow. The radius r of a tube affects the resistance, which again makes sense, because the greater the radius, the greater the flow (all other factors remaining the same). But it is surprising that r is raised to the fourth power in Poiseuille’s law. This exponent means that any change in the radius of a tube has a very large effect on resistance. For example, doubling the radius of a tube decreases resistance by a factor of 2<sup>4</sup>=16.</p>

<p>Taken together, the expression for Q and R give</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>Q</i> = (&Delta;<i>P</i>)&pi;<i>r</i><sup>4</sup>/8&pi;<i>r</i><sup>4</sup></p>
</div>

<p>This equation describes laminar flow through a tube. It is sometimes called Poiseuille’s law for laminar flow, or simply <b>Poiseuille’s law</b>.</p>

<p id="Reynolds">For each fluid to achieve turbulent flow, there is a threshol value dependent on the average liquid flow rate, density, viscosity, and vessel diameter (for internal flows). This characteristic quantity that depends on all of these values is called the Reynolds number</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>R<sub>e</sub></i> = <i>&rho;uD</i>/<i>&mu;</i></p>
</div>

<ul>
	<li><p><i>u</i>: average velocity of the liquid;</p></li>
	<li><p><i>D</i> is th diameter of the vessel;</p></li>
	<li><p>&rho; the fluid density;</p></li>
	<li><p><i>&mu;</i>: dynamic viscosity.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Laminar flow occurs at <i>R<sub>e</sub></i> < 2000. Usually, a low-velocity flow is required, but this also depends on the size of an object. <br>The Reynolds number embodies the fact that inertial forces become smaller relative to viscous forces when the length scales and velocities considered become small (R<sub>e</sub> is proportional to <i>R</i> and <i>U</i>).</p>

<h2>Transport of mass, Péclet number</h2>

<p>Let us, for example, analyze the transport of a tracer substance <i>A</i> with local mass concentration <i>&rho;<sub>A</sub></i>(<i>x,t</i>) by a flow of characteristic velocity <i>U</i>. Assuming that we can neglect the effects of the difference in density introduced by the presence of the tracer, this latter is, on the one hand, carried along by the local velocity of the flow and, onthe other hand, spreads by molecular diffusion. Let us call <i>L</i> a length scale characteristic of the variations in the concentration of the tracer; the diffusive flux of tracer obeys:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><b>J<sub>m</sub></b> = -<i>D<sub>m</sub></i> ∇<i>&rho;<sub>A</sub></i> ≈ <i>D<sub>m</sub></i> <i>&rho;<sub>A</sub></i>/<i>L</i></p>
</div>

<p>where <i>D<sub>m</sub></i> is its molecular diffusion coefficient. For the convective flux we have, by an argument similar to that used for momentum.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>J<sub>conv</sub></i> ≈ <i>&rho;<sub>A</sub>U</i></p>
</div>

<p>The ratio of the fluxes associated with these two mechanisms can be expressed by</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>J<sub>conv</sub></i>/<i>J<sub>m</sub></i> ≈ <i>&rho;<sub>A</sub>U</i>/<i>D<sub>m</sub></i> <i>&rho;<sub>A</sub></i>/<i>L</i> = UL/D<sub>m</sub> = <i>P<sub>e</sub></i></p>
</div>

<p>The ratio P<sub>e</sub>, known as the <b>Péclet number</b>, represents for the phenomena of mass dispersion the equivalent of the Reynolds number for momentum. </p>

<h1>Continuity Equation</h1>

<p>So far, we’ve discussed static fluids. Now we’ll discuss fluids in motion. If something moves, it has to go somewhere. This simple fact is just the conservation of mass (this holds unless you’re in a nuclear reactor, which converts mass to energy). The conservation of mass results in what’s called the continuity equation. Let’s consider a small chunk of moving fluid moving at some speed <b><i>v</i></b>. During some small time interval ∆<i>t</i>, this chunk moves a distance <i>d</i> = <i>v</i>∆<i>t</i>. The volume of fluid that has flowed past this point is therefore <i>V</i> = d<i>A</i> = <i>A</i><i>v</i> ∆<i>t</i>, where <i>A</i> is the cross-sectional area. The mass of this chunk of fluid is therefore</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>∆<i>m</i> = <i>ρ V</i> = <i>ρ A v</i> Δ<i>t</i></p>
</div>

<p>If the fluid is in a steady state, this means mass isn’t accumulating or diminishing. In other words, you’re not doing something like adding a water to a jar. In a steady state, the rate of mass flow must be the same everywhere</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>ρ A v</i> Δ<i>t</i> = constant</p>
</div>

<p>Another way of writing this equation is to say that the mass flow must be the same at any two points in the same fluid. Thus</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>ρ A v</i><sub>1</sub> Δ<i>t</i> = <i>ρ A v</i><sub>2</sub> Δ<i>t</i></p>
</div>

<p>The continuity equation is familiar if you’ve ever handled a garden hose. If you shut off say half of the end with your thumb, you’ve decreased the cross-sectional area <i>A</i> in half. This means that the velocity of the water must double. The water needs to hurry up to get out. In general, this means as a tube gets wider or narrower, the fluid flow gets slower or faster. The continuity equation also applies to gases: the wind gets faster in between large buildings. Again, the point is that the mass must go somewhere. However, it is simpler for a liquid, because of the incompressibility. The density must the same everywhere, so</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>A v<sub>1</sub> Δt</i> = <i>A v<sub>2</sub> Δt</i></p>
</div>

<p>in a liquid.</p>
