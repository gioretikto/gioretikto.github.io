<h1>Harmonic or Sinusoidal Waves</h1>

<p>The analysis of the preceding section has shown that the wave equation is satisfied by <i>any</i> reasonable function <i>x</i> &pm; <i>vt</i>. Of the infinity variety of functions permitted, we choose for closer study waves having a <i>sinusoidal</i> waveform. The reason the sine (or cosine) function occupies a key position in wave theory is fundametally that <i>linear</i> mathematical operations (such as differentiation, integration, and addition) applied to sinusoidal functions of a definite period generate other sinusoidal functions of the <i>same period</i>, differing at most in amplitude and phase. Since many of the interesting applications of wave theory lead to these linear mathematical operations when formulated analytically, it is obvious that waves having a sinusoidal waveform lead to simple results. We've already pointed out that elastic waves d 

<p>Another important, but less fundamental, reason for giving emphasis to sinusoidal waves is based on the fact that the sources of many waves encountered in the real world vibrate periodically, thereby giving rise to periodic waves. Of the class of periodic function, a sinusoidal function has the simplest mathematical properties. Fourier's theorem shows that any periodic function can be expressed as the sum of some harmonic waves. <br>Therefore any wave can be obtained as the superposition of several harmonic waves which, in general, have different angular frequency (or equivalently, frequency or wave-lenght). Each component, identified by its unique angular frequency, is called <i>monochromatic wave</i>. Any wave which consists of several monochromatic wave is called a <i>polychromatic wave</i>.</p>

<p>An important category of waves is harmonic waves which are decribed by a sinusoidal function as</p>

<p>For <b>sine function</b>:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>y</i> = <i>f</i>(<i>vt</i> - <i>t</i>) = <i>A</i> sin[<i>k</i>(<i>x</i> - <i>vt</i> ) + <i>&delta;</i>] = <i>A</i> sin(<i>kx</i> - <i>&omega;t</i>)<br>
or<br><i>f</i>(<i>x, t</i>) = <i>A</i> cos[<i>k</i>(<i>x</i> - <i>vt</i>) + <i>&delta;</i>] &emsp;</p> 
</div>

<p>where <i>A</i> is the amplitude and the introduction into the formula of a quantity <i>k</i>, called <b>wavenumber</b> and whose unit of measurement is [m<sup>-1</sup>] is mandatory, because the argument of a trigonometric function must be dimensionless. The obtained quantity <i>&omega;</i> = <i>kv</i> is called <b>angular frequency</b></i> of the wave.</p>

<p>In view of <b>Euler's fomula</b>, l'onda armonica può essere scritta come</p>

<p>f(x, t) = Re [A e<sup> k( x - vt ) + &delta;</sup>]</p> 

<p>Where Re indicates the real part of a complex number.</p>

<p>la costante di fase viene inglobata nell'<b>ampiezza complessa</b> Ã &equiv; A e<sup>i&delta;</sup>. The <i>actual</i> wave function is the real part of f. If you know f&tilde;, it is a simple matter to find <i>f</i>; the advantage of the complex notation is that exponential are much easier to manipulate than sines and cosines.</p>
