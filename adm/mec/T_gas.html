<h1>Temperature of a gas</h1>

<p>In the previou section we have found that the product of pressure and volume of a given sample of gas is a function only of the mean kinetic energy of the gas.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>pV</i> = 2/3 ⋅ <i>nN<sub>A</sub></i> ⋅ ⟨<i>E<sub>k</sub></i>⟩</p>
</div>

<p>Let us now compare this equation with the equation of state for an ideal gas:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>pV</i> = <i>nRT</i></p>
</div>

<p>from which we know that at constant tempetaure the product of volume and pressure of an ideal gas is constant. We must conclude from this that, the mean kinetic energy ⟨<i>E<sub>k</sub></i>⟩, depends only on the temperature of the gas. <br> In the kinetic theory of gases, the concept of temperature is primarily a foreign element, since in fact the individual molecules are characterized by their velocity alone. But it suggests itself that we should define the absolute gas-temperature <i>T</i> in terms of the mean kinetic energy. This is usually done in accordance with tho equation</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>½ ⋅ <i>m</i> ⟨<i>v<sub>x</sub></i><sup>2</sup>⟩ = ½ <i>kT</i></p>
</div>

<p>where on the left we have the mean kinetic energy of a component of the motion of the centre of inertia of a molecule; <i>k</i> is called <i>Boltzmann's constant</i>. For the total motion of the centre of inertia we have therefore</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>½ ⋅ <i>m</i> ⟨<i>v</i><sup>2</sup>⟩ = 3/2 ⋅ <i>kT</i></p>
</div>

<p>and, referred to a mole,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>U</i> = ⟨<i>v</i><sup>2</sup>⟩<i>N<sub>A</sub>m</i>/2 = 3/2 ⋅ <i>RT</i></p>
</div>

<p>where we put</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>N<sub>A</sub>k</i> = <i>R</i></p>
</div>

<p>The justification for this definition of temperature lies in the fact chat when we introduce the last expression in the formula for the gas pressure deduced in the <a ahref="P_gas.html#pV">previous section</a>, we obtain formally <i>pV</i> = <i>nRT</i>, relation.</p>

<p>We use the phrase ideal gas if the product <i>pV</i> is constant at constant temperature; for low pressures this is true for every gas. Deviations from the ideal character of the gas occur when the density of the gas becomes so great that the mean distance between two gas molecules is comparable with the molecular diameter. <br> If we employ such
an ideal gas as thermometric substance, the centigrade scale is defined as follows. Let (<i>pV</i>)<sub>f</sub>, be the value of <i>pV</i> for the gas, when it is brought into contact with melting ice, and (<i>pV</i>)<sub>b</sub> its value for contact with boiling water; then tho temperature of the gas, for the general case of any value of <i>pV</i>, is defined according to the centigrade</p>

<p>We see at once that, with this definition, the temperature of melting ice is 0 °C. and that of boiling water 100 °C. </p>

<p>The change from the centigrade scale to the absolute temperature (Lord Kelvin, 1854) scale, which we have indicated above by the syinbol <i>T</i>, is made as follows. It has been established experimentally that at constant pressure an ideal gas expands by 1/273 of its volume at 0 °C, when its temperature is raised by 1 °C (<a href="../thermo/Charles.html">Charles's law</a>). Let a gas at freezing temperature, be heated through 100 °C, then the change in volume would be 100/273 of the volume at freezing temperature

<div class="eq">
<p>(<i>pV</i>)<sub>b</sub> = (<i>pV</i>)<sub>f</sub> + 100/273 ⋅ (<i>pV</i>)<sub>f</sub> = (1 + 100/273)  (<i>pV</i>)<sub>f</sub></p>
</div>

<p>dividing by (<i>pV</i>)<sub>f</sub></p>

<div class="eq">
<p>(<i>pV</i>)<sub>b</sub> / (<i>pV</i>)<sub>f</sub> = <i>T<sub>b</sub></i> / <i>T<sub>f</sub></i> = (1 + 100/273) = 373/273</p>
</div>

<p>If we retain the unit of the centigrade scale in the absolute scale also, <i>T<sub>b</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>f</sub></i>, must difer by 100°C. It follows that melting ice (<i>t</i> = 0° C.) has the absolute temperature <i>T<sub>f</sub></i> = 273°, and boiing water (<i>t</i> = 100° C.) the absolute temperature <i>T<sub>b</sub></i> = 373 °C. The zero of the absolute temperature scale lies therefore at —273° C.<br> It may be remarked that the absolute temperature scale is sometimes called the <i>Kelvin scale</i>, and to distinguish it from the ordinary centigrade scale is denoted by <i>K</i>.</p>
