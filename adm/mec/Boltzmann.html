<h1>Boltzmann distribution</h1>

<p>As the next stop in the development of the kinetic theory of gases, we proceed to consider the law of distribution of energy or velocity in a gas, i.e., in particular, the law of dependence of the quantity <i>n<sub>v</sub></i> (number of molecules possessing velocity <i>v</i>), employed above, on the velocity. Whiile up to tins point a few simple ideas have been sufficient for our purpose, we must now definitely call to our aid the statistical methods of the Calculus of Probabilities. </p>

<p><b>Example 1</b>. Consider a gas consisting of just three indistinguishable molecules, which we label <i>a, b, c</i>. Let's assume there are two possible energy levels and that the gas has a total energy of 4&epsilon;. We can achieve this by putting two molecules in the lowest, &epsilon;, energy level and one in the 2&epsilon; energy level. How many permutations are possible? There are just three. We can put molecules <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> into the lowest energy level and <i>c</i> in the next, a permutation we can label as [<i>ab,c</i>]. We can also put molecules <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> in the lowest energy bucket, and <i>b</i> in the next, labelled [<i>ac,b</i>]. The third possible permutations is [<i>bc,a</i>]. These three permutations results in a change of <i>arrangement</i>, but it does not change the <i>distribution</i> (energy distribution) of the molecules, that is the the number of molecules in each level, since it is the same in the three arrangements.</p>

<p>< If we now consider an assembly of <i>N</i> identical molecules of a gas at a temperature <i>T</i> and volume <i>V</i> and total energy <i>E</i>. Let <i>N</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>N</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>N</i><sub>2</sub>, .., etc group of molecules to be placed in energy levels <i>&epsilon;</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>&epsilon;</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>&epsilon;</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., etc, in such a way that the total number of molecules and total enrgy are constant.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>N</i> = &Sigma; <i>N<sub>i</sub></i><br>
<i>E</i> = &Sigma; <i>E<sub>i</sub>&epsilon;<sub>i</sub></i></p>
</div>

<p>The number of ways in which the molecules can be distributed into different energy levels is calculates by the principle of <a href="../math/prob/permutations.html#rep">permutations with repetitions</a>, i.e. the same principle of counting the number of anagrams of a word with repeated letters, where the different letters here represent the energy levels and the number of repeated letters, the number of molecules in the same energy level. <br> Thus this number is expressed as</p>

<!-- $$\frac{N!}{N_0!N_1!N_2! \ldots} $$ -->

<p>The symbol <i>W</i> for probability comes from the first letter of the german word Wahrscheinlichkeit, meaning probability. This is a very large number if <i>N</i> is large. A useful formula to calculate factorials of large numbers is <i>Stirling's approximation</i></p>

<div class="eq">
<p>ln <i>N</i>! = <i>N</i> ln <i>N</i> − <i>N</i></p>
</div>

<p>if we take the natural logarithm of both sides of Eq. 1.m use Stirling's approximation fo the factorials and use N<sub>0</sub> + ... N

<p>Thus for the example above of three molecules and two energy levels with total energy 4<i>&epsilon;</i> we obtain the three possible arrangements for the particular energy distribution as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>W</i> = 3!/2!1!&emsp;■</p>
</div>

<p><b>Example 2</b>. Suppose there are 15 molecules particles which have to be put in groups of 3, 4, 5, 2, 1. The number of ways of arranging them are</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>15!/ 3! 4! 5! 2! 1! = 37837800.</p>
</div>

<p>This can be calculated as follows. If there is no restriction on group placement, the number of ways would be 15!. Since one has to place the particles in groups, the number has to be divided by 3! 4! 5! 2! 1!.&emsp;■</p>

<p><b>Example 2</b>. Calculate the number of ways of distributing distinguishable molecules <i>a,b,c</i> between three energy levels so as to obtain the following distribution: <i>N</i><sub>0</sub> = 1, <i>N</i><sub>1</sub> = 1, <i>N</i><sub>2</sub> = 1, that is each energy level is occupied by one molecule. </p>

<p><b>Solution</b>. The number of arrangements leading to the same energy distribution is given by</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>W</i> = 3!/1!1!1! = 6/1 = 6&emsp;■</p>
</div>

<p><p>To begin with a simple exampie, let us in the first place, without troubling about velocity, corisider the question of the number of molecules which on the average are to be found in a define volume element <i>&omega;</i>. An exact determination of this number is impossible and would be of little use, since the number changes every moment on account of the motion of the molecules; we are therefore concerned only with the average number of molecules. This we determine as follows. Imagine the whole box containing the gas to be fivided up into separate cells of sizes <i>&omega;</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>&omega;</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., <i>&omega;<sub>s</sub></i>, and throw the molecules which we may think of as little balls, at random into this system. We then note a definite number <i>n</i><sub>1</sub> of balls has fallen into the first cell, another number <i>n</i><sub>2</sub>, and so on. At a second trial, we shall perhaps find other values for the number of balls in the various cells. If we repeat the experiment a great many times, we shall find htat a given distribution, defines by the numbers <i>n</i><sub>1</sub>, ..., <i>n<sub>s</sub></i> occurs not merely once, but many times. For a model consisting of a real box divided up into cells, and real valls, the frequency with which a given distribution appears could be determined by a long series of trials For a gas and its molecules this is not possible, we have to use instead an arithemtical argument, constiting of a numerical part (concerning the numbers <i>n</i><sub>1</sub>, ..., <i>n<sub>s</sub></i>) and a geometrical part (concerning the sizes <i>&omega;</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>&omega;</i><sub>1</sub>, ..., <i>&omega;<sub>s</sub></i>). In this way we shall find the mathemcaitcal probability of a given distribution and when we take all possible distributions into account, there is one, for which this probability is greatest. The most porbable distribution represents the average state.</p>

<p>The word 'ergodic' derives from the Greek εργoν (ergon: 'work', 'energy') and ὁδός (odon: 'route', 'path'). The term was introduced by Boltzmann in 1887 in his study of time development of mechanical particle system.
