<h1>Flow Classification</p>

<p>When fluids move through a closed conduit of any cross-section, one of two different types of flow may occur. These two flow types are most easily visualized by referring to a classic experiment first performed by Osborne Reynolds in 1883. In Reynolds’ experiment, a glass lube was connected to a reservoir of water in such a way that the velocity of the water flowing through the tube could be varied. A nozzle was inserted in the inlet end of the tube through which a fine stream of colored dye could be introduced.<br> Reynolds found that when the velocity of the water was low, the “thread” of dye color maintained itself throughout the tube. By locating the nozzle at different points in the cross-section it was shown that there was no mixing of the dye with water and that the dye flowed in parallel, straight lines. <br> At high velocities, it was found that the “line” or “thread” of dye disappeared and the entire mass of flowing water was uniformly colored with the dye. In other words, the liquid, instead of flowing in an orderly manner parallel to the long axis of the tube, was now flowing in an erratic manner and so there was complete mixing.</p>

<p>These two forms of fluid motion are known as laminar or viscous flow that occurs at low velocity, and turbulent flow that occurs at high velocity. The velocity at which the flow changes from laminar to turbulent is defined as the critical velocity [1].</p>

<h2>The Reynolds Number</h2>

<p>Reynolds, in a later study of the conditions under which the two types of flow might occur, showed that the critical velocity depended on the diameter of the tube, the velocity of the fluid, its density, and its viscosity. Further, Reynolds showed that the term representing these four quantities could be combined in a manner that later came to be defined as the Reynolds number.</p>

<p>The Reynolds number, Re, is a dimensionless quantity, and can be shown to be the ratio of inertia to viscous forces in the fluid:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>Re= Epv = Ll v (13.1)</p>
</div>

<p>where L is a characteristic length, p is the fluid density, v is the average velocity, pt is the dynamic (or absolute) viscosity, and v is the kinematic viscosity. In flow
through round pipes and tubes, L is the diameter of the pipe or tube, D.<br> The Reynolds number provides information on flow behavior, and Reynolds number calculations become important and are necessary for determining flow regimes, i.e., laminar versus turbulent. It is particularly useful in scaling up benchscale or pilot data to full-scale applications. Laminar flow is always encounteredat a Reynolds number, Re < 2100 in a circular duct, but it can persist up to higher Reynolds numbers in very smooth pipes. However, the flow is unstable at higher
Reynolds numbers, and small disturbances may cause a transition to turbulent flow. Very slow flow (in circular ducts) for which Re < 1 is termed creeping or Stokes flow. Under ordinary conditions of flow (in circular ducts), the flow is turbulent at a Reynolds number above 4000. A transition region is observed between 2100 and 4000, where the type of flow may be either laminar or turbulent, and predictions are unreliable. The Reynolds numbers at which the fluid flow changes from laminar to transition or to turbulent flow are termed critical Reynolds numbers. In other than circular geometries, different critical Re criteria exist. <br> For most environmental engineering applications, one can assume turbulent (high Reynolds number) flow for gases. The reader should also note that the Reynolds number appears in many semi-empirical and empirical equations that involve fluid flow, heat transfer, and mass transfer applications. For flow in non-circular conduits, some other appropriate length (termed the hydraulic radius) replaces the diameter in Re. This is discussed later in this chapter.
<br> As noted in Chapter 10, applying the conservation law of energy mandates that all forms of energy entering a system equal that of those leaving. Expressing all  term in consistent units, e.g., energy per unit mass of fluid flowing, resulted in the total energy balance equation ...</p>
