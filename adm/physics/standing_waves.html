<h1>Standing waves</h1>

<p>If you and a partner shake both ends of a taut rope with the same frequency and same amplitude, you will observe an interesting result. The inreference of the identical waves coming from opposite ends results in certain points on the rope not moving at all! In between these nodal points, the entire rope oscillates up and down. But there is no apparent propagation of wave patterns in either direction along the rope. The phenomenon is called a <i>standing wave</i> or a <i>stationary wave</i>. The remarkable thing behind this phenomenon is that the standing oscillation you observe is really the effect of two <i>travelling</i> waves.  To make standing waves on a rope (or Slinky), there do not have to be two people shaking the opposite ends. One end can be tied to a hook on a wall or to a door knob. When the medium through which a wave can travel is <b>confined</b>, it can only support waves of <b>certain wavelenghts</b>, known as <b>harmonics</b>. <br> When a <b>harmonic wave</b> reaches the <b>end of the medium</b> and <b>reflects</b>, its reflection continues to the <b>original wave patter</b>, resulting in a wave that is a <b>precise mirror image of the original</b> (it is of opposite phae; 180° or out of phase). The reflected wave train interferes both constructively and destructively with the incident wave train. The constructive and distructive interference results in alternate nodes (destructive) and antinodes (constructive) appearing on the medium.</p>

<p>You can tie both ends of a string to hooks and pluc (or bow) the string. From the plucked point a pair of waves go out in opposiste direction, and are then reflected from the ends. The interference of these reflected waves that travel in opposite directions can produce a standing pattern just as before. The strings of guitars, violins, pianos, and all the other stringes instrumets act in just this fashion. The energy given to the strings sets up standing waves. Some of the energy is then trasmitted from the vibrating string to the body of the instrument; the sound waves sent forth from there are at essentially the ssame frequency as the standing waves on the string. The vibration frequencies at which standing waves can exist depend on two factos. On the speed of wave propagation along the string. The other is the lenght of the string.</p>

<p>According to a famous Greek legend, the philosopher Pytagoras discovered the basic pattern of harmonics after hearing the different tobes caused by hammers of different weights striking an anvil. In reality the experiments of Pytagoras and his followers used plucked strings of diferent lenghts and weights.</p>

<p>To analyze a standing wave, let us suppose the incident wave <i>u<sub>m</sub></i> sin(<i>kx</i> - <i>&omega;t</i>) generates a reflected wave of the same amplitude as that of the incident way <i>u<sub>m</sub></i> sin(<i>kx</i> + <i>&omega;t</i>). The principle of superposition gives, for the combined wave,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>u</i>(<i>x,t</i>) = <i>u<sub>m</sub></i> sin(<i>kx</i> - <i>&omega;t</i>) + <i>u<sub>m</sub></i> sin(<i>kx</i> + <i>&omega;t</i>)</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>u</i>(<i>x,t</i>) = [2<i>u<sub>m</sub></i> sin(<i>kx</i>)] cos(<i>&omega;t</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>This equation does not describe a traveling wave because it is not of the form of <i>f</i>(<i>kx</i> &pm; <i>&omega;t</i>), where <i>f</i> represents <i>any</i> function, the sine function bein one possibility. Instead, it describes a standing wave. The quantity 2<i>u<sub>m</sub></i> sin <i>kx</i> in the brackets of the equation can be viewed as the amplitude of oscillation of the string element that is located at position <i>x</i>. However, since an amplitude is always positive and sin kx can be negative, we take the absolute value of the quantity 2<i>u<sub>m</sub></i> sin(<i>kx</i>) to be the amplitude at <i>x</i>. <br>In a traveling sinusoidal wave, the amplitude of the wave is the same for all string elements. That is not true for a standing wave, in which the amplitude <i>varies</i> with position. In the standing wave of Eq. 16-60, for example, the amplitude is zero for values of kx that give sin <i>kx</i> = 0. Those values are</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>kx</i> = <i>n&pi;</i>, for <i>n</i> = 0,1,2, ....</p>
</div>

<p>Substituting <i>k</i> = 2&pi; A in this equation and rearranging, we get</p>
