<h1>Legge</h1>

<p>When you’re first learning Chinese, you learn that 吧 (ba) is used to turn a statement into a suggestion. Easy enough, right? But you’ll soon find that isn’t the only way that 吧 (ba) is used! <br> This tends to trip up many students along the learning journey, but don’t worry! To set the record straight, we’ve created this infographic listing out the main 4 ways that 吧 (ba) is used in Chinese. </p>

<h2> #1: Used to indicate a suggestion</h2>

<p>When you’re giving a suggestion, it’s highly advisable to add 吧 (ba) at the end of the sentence. Otherwise, it will sound more like an order than a friendly suggestion. <br> You definitely don’t want to make that mistake with your superiors or in-laws! Examples: </p>

<ul>
	<li><p>我们走吧！(wǒ men zǒu ba) - Let’s go! / Let’s leave!</p></li>
	<li><p>我们明天一起吃晚饭吧！(wǒ men míng tiān yì qǐ chī wǎn fàn ba) - Let’s have dinner together tomorrow!</p></li>
	<li><p>你跟他说一下吧。(nǐ gēn tā shuō yí xia ba) - Let him know. (polite)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Like in the third example above, you’ll also often see 吧 (ba) used with a phrase that softens the tone, like 一下 (yí xia) or doubling the verb, which makes it sound extra polite.</p>

<h2>#2: Used to indicate agreement or approval </h2>

<p>This next use of 吧 (ba) communicates agreement or approval of something, but it also has a bit of reluctance to it.  <br> It is most often used following the words 好 (hǎo) - "OK" and 行 (xíng) - “alright”. Adding 吧 (ba) this way can be a bit similar to the tone of “fine” in English, though not quite as harsh.  <br> Again, this use of 吧 (ba) is something you’ll want to avoid saying to your boss! Just say 好的 (hǎo de) or 好 (hǎo) for “OK” and you’re golden! Examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>好吧。明天也行。(hǎo ba míng tiān yě xíng) - OK. Tomorrow works too. / Fine. Tomorrow works too.</p></li>
	<li><p>行吧。我们只能这样了。(xíng ba wǒ men zhǐ néng zhè yàng le) - Alright. That’s all we can do. / Fine. That’s all we can do.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>#3: Used to indicate uncertainty or guess about something</h2>

<p>This is a VERY common use of 吧 (ba), which you’ll see a lot in questions as well as statements. This use of 吧 (ba) is used to communicate some level of uncertainty, or to make an educated guess about something. You can use it when you’re somewhat certain about something, but not 100% sure. Examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>你会说普通话吧？(nǐ huì shuō pǔ tōng huà ba) - You speak Mandarin, right?</p></li>
	<li><p>他明年就要毕业了，对吧？(tā míng nián jiù yào bì yè le duì ba) - He is graduating next year, right?</p></li>
	<li><p>应该没什么问题吧。(yīng gāi méi shén me wèn tí ba) - There shouldn’t be any issues.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>#4: Used to indicate a pause when weighing options/making comparisons</h2>

<p>Note: In this case, the “ba” is usually repeated twice.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>夏天去北京吧，天气会很热，冬天去北京吧，天气会很冷。(xià tiān qù běi jīng ba, tiān qì huì hěn rè, dōng tiān qù běi jīng ba, tiān qì huì hěn lěng) - If we go to Beijing in the summer, the weather will be hot. If we go to Beijing in the winter, the weather will be cold.</p></li>

	<li><p>跟老板说吧，他会很不开心，不跟老板说吧，公司可能会出大事。(gēn lǎo bǎn shuō ba, tā huì hěn bù kāi xīn, bù gēn lǎo bǎn shuō ba, gōng sī kě néng huì chū dà shì) - If you tell the boss, he won’t be happy. If you don’t tell the boss, the company might run into some big issues.</p></li>

</ul>
