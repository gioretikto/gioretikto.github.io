<h1>Conditionals</h1>

<p>Conditional tenses are used to speculate about what could happen, what might have happened, and what we wish would happen. In English, most sentences using the conditional contain the word <em>if</em>. Many conditional forms in English are used in sentences that include verbs in one of the past tenses. This usage is referred to as "the unreal past" because we use a past tense but we are not actually referring to something that happened in the past. There are five main ways of constructing conditional sentences in English. In all cases, these sentences are made up of an <em>if</em> clause and a main clause. In many negative conditional sentences, there is an equivalent sentence construction using "unless" instead of "if".</p>

<h3>The zero conditional</h3>

<p>The zero conditional is used for when the time being referred to is <strong>now or always</strong> and the situation is <strong>real and possible</strong>. The zero conditional is often used to refer to general truths. The tense in both parts of the sentence is the simple present. In zero conditional sentences, the word "if" can usually be replaced by the word "when" without changing the meaning.</p>

<h3>Type 1 conditional</h3>

<p>The type 1 conditional is used to refer to the <strong>present or future</strong> where the <strong>situation is real</strong>.

<h3>Type 2 conditional</h3>

<p>The type 2 conditional is used to refer to a time that is <strong>now or any time</strong>, and a situation that is <strong>unreal</strong>. These sentences are not based on fact. The type 2 conditional is used to refer to a hypothetical condition and its probable result. In type 2 conditional sentences, the if clause uses the simple past, and the main clause uses the present conditional.</p>

<tbody>

<tr><td><strong>If + simple past</strong></td>
<td><strong>present conditional or present continuous conditional</strong></td></tr>

<h3>Type 3 conditional</h3>

The facts they are based on are the opposite of what is expressed. The type 3 conditional is used to refer to an unreal past condition and its probable past result. In type 3 conditional sentences, the if clause uses the past perfect, and the main clause uses the perfect conditional.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>

<th>Main clause</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>If + past perfect</strong></td>
<td><strong>perfect conditional or perfect continuous conditional</strong></td>

<h3>Mixed type conditional</h3>

The facts they are based on are the opposite of what is expressed. The mixed type conditional is used to refer to an unreal past condition and its probable result in the present. In mixed type conditional sentences, the if clause uses the past perfect, and the main clause uses the present conditional.</p>
