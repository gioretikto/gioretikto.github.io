<h1>Negative sentences</h1>
 
<p>We call a sentence <b>negatives</b> if it contains negative words like:</p>

<p><i>not, no, none, nothing, nowhere, neither, nobody, no one, hardly, scarcely, barely</i>.</p>

<p>Two negatives should never be used together in the same sentence.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>Right (one negative): <i>«He told me nothing about it»</i> or <i>«He told me nothing about it»</i></p></li>
    <li><p>Wrong (two negatives): <i>He di <b>not</b> tell me <b>nothing</b> about it</i>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you use negative words <b>twice</b> in a sentence, the sentence becomes positive instead of negative. Two negative in the same sentence cancel each other out and create a positive sentence, so When a sentence contains the word not, the indefinite word that is the opposite of the negative word must be used: <i>I am not studying anything</i>. e.g.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><i>It is <b>not</b> an <b>un</b>common sight = It is a common sight</i></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Negative and positive responses</h2>

<p><b>so</b> = usually used before the verbe do, be, and have, the modal can, and other auxiliary verbs to express the meaning “in the same way” or “similarly”.</p>

<p><b>too</b> = used especially at the end of a sentence to show “in addition” or “also”.</p>

<p><b>either/neither</b> = used with or as negative expressions to show that the listener agrees with the speaker's former negative comment.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>The word “either” is used with a negative verb (e.g. have NOT).</p></li>
    <li><p>The word “neither” is used with an affirmative (positive) verb (e.g. have).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Both have the same meaning! Let’s look at one of the previous examples.</p>

<p>A: My mother can’t drive a car.</p>

<p>B: My mother can’t (drive) either. / Neither can my mom.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the second example:</p>

<p>A: I haven’t seen Michael today.</p>

<p>B: I haven’t (seen him) either. / Neither have I. </p>

<p><b>Rule</b>: when the verb is negative, you cannot use “too.” Remember that we are talking about the verb and NOT the meaning of the message. For example, “I hate carrots.” has a negative meaning, but the verb hate is not in a negative form. If you also hate carrots, you have to say “Me too!” since the previous sentence does not have “NOT” in it.</p>

<p>Initial positive statement: I like Japanese food a lot. Two responses showing agreement: So do I./I do, too.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>One response showing disagreement: Really? I don't like it very much. Initial negative statement: I don’t like greasy food.</p></li>

	<li><p>Two responses showing agreement: Neither do I./I don’t either.</p></li>
	<li><p>One response showing disagreement: Oh, I like it a lot.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Point out how the adverbs so and too are used to show agreement in responses to initial positive statements, like this:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>When a verb other than <i>be</i> is in the initial statement (e.g., “I lovel like/enjoy ...."), use <i>do</i> or <i>don’t</i> in the response (e.g., “So do I./I do, I like it too / Me too.” for agreement, or “I don't.” for disagreement).</p></li>

	<li><p>When the verb <i>be</i> is in the initial statement (e.g., “I'm crazy about... .”), use am or 'm not in the response (o.g., “So am I/I am, too.” for agreement, or “I’m not.”
for disagreement).</p></li>

	<li><p>When the modal <i>can</i> is in the initial statement (e.g., “I can eat... .”), use can or can’t in the response (e.g., “So can I/I can, too.” for agreement, or “I can't.” for disagreement).</p></li>
</ol>
