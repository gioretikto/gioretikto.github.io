<h1>Historical Background of Ukraine</h1>

<p>Following the <b>Christianization of Rus</b>' by Prince <b>Volodymyr the Great</b> in 988, Kyiv became a major religious center. Under his son Yaroslav the Wise, the city reached its zenith. Yaroslav further extended the boundaries of Kyiv, constructing fortifications and the St. Sophia Cathedral. Kyiv maintained diplomatic relations with Byzantium and the major West European powers and became a center of scholarship, writing, and painting. Its population reached 50,000—100,000 by the 12th century.<br> The city also engaged in a series of wars against nomadic tribes such as the Khazars, Pechenegs, and Cumans, who lived in the steppes to the south. A greater threat came from internecine conflicts for the Kyivan throne that began after Yaroslav’s death (1054): Andrei Bogoliubsky of Suzdal sacked Kyiv in 1169, as did Riuryk Rostyslavych in 1203.</p>

<h3>The Tatars</h3>

<p>In 1240 Mongol Tatar invaders lay waste to Kyiv, completing the downfall of Kyivan Rus. Immediate consequences of this event were the dissolution of the state, the establishment of smaller principalities on the periphery of the territory, and therefore a break in the continuity of linguistic evolution − heretofore centred on Kyiv. Tatar rule had no lasting affect on the developmente of local dialectr, barring the adoption of a few words that were specific to Tatar material culture.</p>

<p>In 1362-63, Algirdas of Lithuania annexed the Kyivan land as an appanage principality, and his descendants ruled the city until 1470. In 1471, Kyiv became the capital of the Kyiv voivodeship and was governed by Lithuanian viceroys until 1569. At the time, Kyiv was reduced to a minor market town on the Lithuanian-Tatar frontier. The city suffered greatly from Tatar raids, particularly the attack of 1482 by Khan Mengli Giray, an ally of Ivan III of Muscovy, after which the upper city lay in ruins for more than a century.</p>

<h3>The Poles</h3>

<p>The eventual collpase of Tatar control over Kievean Rus' left a power vacum, into which the Polish-Lithuanian (but primarily Polish) state entered in the course of the fifteenth century. After the Union of Lublin (1569), Kyiv came under Polish rule. This historical development differed markedly from teh Tatar period, as Polish became a true <i>lingua franca</i>. in the Ukrainian-Belarusian lands: Polish rule penetrated deeply into daily life in these regions, whth the result that Polish was widely spoken. The consequences fro later Ukranian (and Belarusian) remain evident today, as a substantial proportion of the Ukrainian lexicon consists of borrowings from the Polish language.</p>

<p>In the early 17th century, Kyiv experienced a renaissance, becoming the political, religious, and cultural center of Ukraine. The Kyiv Epiphany Brotherhood and the Kyivan Cave Monastery Press were established. Metropolitan Petro Mohyla, in particular, did much to make Kyiv an important cultural center, initiating and funding the restoration of many of the city’s churches and establishing the school that would become the Kyiv Mohyla Academy. Bohdan Khmelnytsky cleared the city of Polish forces in 1648, but the Polish-Lithuanian army struck back in 1651.</p>

<h3>The Russians</h3>

<p>After the <b>Pereiaslav Agreement (1654)</b>, a Muscovite fortress was built in Kyiv, and the Truce of Andrusovo (1667) granted the city to Muscovy for two years. The Muscovites, however, managed to take control of Kyiv, sealing their acquisition by means of the Eternal Peace of 1686. Kyiv’s architecture and culture developed significantly under the patronage of Hetman Ivan Mazepa. After Mazepa’s defeat at the Battle of Poltava (1709), Kyiv’s autonomy was progressively eliminated and restrictions were imposed on Ukrainian merchants, while Russians and other received preferential treatment. </p>

<p>Polish hegemony lasted until the middle of the seventeenth century, after which much of what is Ukraine today was brought into the Russian Empire; after a short period of independence following the Bolshevik revolution in 1917, Ukraine was made part of the Soviet Union.</p>
