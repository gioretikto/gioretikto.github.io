<p class="p1" style="display:block"><strong>1.</strong> Annos undeviginti natus exercitum privato consilio et privata impensa comparavi, per quem rem publicam a dominatione factionis oppressam in libertatem vindicavi. Eo nomine senatus decretis honorificis in ordinem suum me adlegit C. Pansa et A. Hirtio consulibus, consularem locum simul dans sententiae ferendae, et imperium mihi dedit. Res publica, ne quid detrimenti caperet, a me pro praetore simul cum consulibus providendum iussit. Populus autem eodem anno me consulem, cum cos. uterque in bello cecidisset, et triumvirum rei publicae costituendae creavit.</p>

<p class="p1" style="display:block"><strong>1.</strong> At the age of ninteen, I raised an army at my own responsability and my own expense, with which I defended the liberty of the Republic, which had been oppressed by the domain of a despotic faction. For this reason the senate passed honorific decrees admitting me to its body in the consulship of Gaius Pansa and Aulus Hirtius, assigning me the right to give my opinion among the consulars and giving me supreme command. With me as propraetor, it ordered me, together with the consuls, to provide that the republic should come to no harm. In the same year, whe both consuls had perished in battle, the people apponted me consuls and triumvir to reestablish order in the republic.</p>
 
<p class="p2" style="display:none"><strong>2.</strong> Qui parentem meum interfecerunt, eos in exilium expuli iudiciis legitimis ultus eorum facinus, et postea bellum inferentis rei publicae vici bis acie.</p>
 
<p class="p2" style="display:none"><strong>2.</strong> I drove into exile those who murdered my father by punishing their crime with legal procedures; and then moving them war to the republic I defeated them twice in battle.</p>
 
<p class="p3" style="display:none"><strong>3.</strong> Bella terra et mari civilia externaque toto in orbe terrarum saepe gessi victorque omnibus veniam petentibus civibus peperci. Externas gentes, quibus tuto ignosci potuit, conservare quam excidere malui. Millia civium Romanorum sub sacramento meo fuerunt circiter quingenta. Ex quibus deduxi in colonias aut remisi in municipia sua stipendis emeritis millia aliquanto plura quam trecenta et iis omnibus agros adsignavi aut pecuniam pro praemis militiae dedi. Naves cepi sescentas praeter eas, si quae minores quam triremes fuerunt.</p>
 
<p class="p3" style="display:none"><strong>3.</strong> I often waged civil and foreign wars all over the world on land and sea; and as a winner, I spared all those citizens who implored me grace. I preferred to preserve, rather than exterminate the foreign peoples, that could be pardoned in safety. Almost five hundred thousand Roman citizens in arms under my insignia; of whom I sent more than three hundred thousand to colonies or sent back to their town halls, having completed their military service; and to all of them I assigned lands or donated money in return for milatary service. I captured six hundred ships in addition to those smaller than triremes.</p>

<p class="p4" style="display:none"><strong>4.</strong> Bis ovans triumphavi, tris egi curulis triumphos et appellatus sum viciens et semel imperator. Cum autem pluris triumphos mihi senatus decrevisset, iis supersedi. Laurum de fascibus deposui in Capitolio, votis quae quoque bello nuncupaveram solutis. Ob res a me aut per legatos meos auspicis meis terra marique prospere gestas quinquagiens et quinquiens decrevit senatus supplicandum esse dis immortalibus. Dies autem, per quos ex senatus consulto supplicatum est, fuere DCCCLXXXX. In triumphis meis ducti sunt ante currum meum reges aut regum liberi novem. Consul fueram terdeciens, cum scribebam haec, et agebam septimum et tricensimum tribuniciae potestatis.</p> 
 
<p class="p4" style="display:none"><strong>4.</strong> Twice I triumphed with an ovation, and three times I enjoyed a curule triumph and twenty one times I was named emperor. Even though the senate decreed more triumphs for me, I declined all of them. I laid the aid the laurel from his fasces in the Capitol, thus dissolving the solemn vows I had pronounced for each war. On account of the accomplishments done by me and by my officers, under my auspices, on earth and sea, the senate decreed fifty-five times that there be sacrifices to the immortal gods. Moreover by decree of the Senate there were 890 days during which supplication was made. In my triumphs, nine kings or children of kings were led before the char. I had been consul thirteen times, when I wrote this, and I was in the thirty-seventh year of tribunician power.</p>
 
<p class="p5" style="display:none"><strong>5.</strong> Dictaturam et apsenti et praesenti mihi delatam et a populo et a senatu M. Marcello et L. Arruntio consulibus non recepi. 2. non sum deprecatus in summa frumenti penuria curationem annonae, quam ita administraui ut intra dies paucos metu et periclo praesenti civitatem universam liberarem impensa et cura mea. Consulatum quoque tum annuum et perpetuum mihi delatum non recepi.</p> 
 
 <p class="p5" style="display:none"><strong>5.</strong> I did not accept the dictatorship that under the consulship Marcellus and Lucius Arruntius had been offered to me both by the people and the Senate, both while I was absent and while I was present in Rome. I did not decline at a time of the greatest scarcity of grain the responsibility of the grain-supply, which I so administered that, within a few days, I freed the entire people, at my own expense, from the fear and danger in which they were. I did not accept the consulship - either yearly, or for life -, which was then offered to me.</p>
 
 <p class="p6" style="display:none"><strong>6.</strong> Consulibus M. Vinicio et Q. Lucretio et postea P.Lentulo et Cn. Lentulo et tertium Paullo Fabio Maximo et Q. Tuberone senatu popoloque Romano consentientibus ut curator legum et morum maxima potestate solus crearer nullum magistratum contra morem maiorem delatum recepi. Quae tum per me geri senatus voluit, per tribuniciam potestatem perfecti, cuius potestatis conlegam et ipse ultra quinquiens a senatu depoposci et accepi.</p> 
 
<p class="p6" style="display:none"><strong>6.</strong> In the consulship of Consulibus Marcus Vinicius et Quintus Lucretius and later of Publius Fabius Maximus and Quintus Tubero, even though the senate and people of Rome were in agreement that I should be appointed on my own as guardian of laws and customs with supreme power. I accepted no magistracy conferred upon me that contraved ancestral custom. The things which the senate wanted to be accomplished by me at that time, I escuted by virtue of my tribunician power, for which power I myself, of my own accord, five times demanded and received a colleague from the senate. </p>
  
<p class="p7" style="display:none"><strong>7.</strong> Triumvirum rei publicae constituendae fui per continuos annos decem. Princeps senatus fui usque ad eum diem quo scripseram haec per annos quadraginta. Pontifex maximus, augur, XV virum sacris faciundis, VII virum epulonum, frater arvalis, sodalis Titius, fetialis fui.</p>
 
<p class="p7" style="display:none"><strong>7.</strong> I was triumviro to reorganize the Republic for ten consecutive years. I was Princeps senatus until the day I wrote these memoirs for 40 years. And I was the Pontifex Maximus, augur, one of the fifteen for conducting the sacred ceremonies, of the seven in charge of feasts, Arval brother, member of the fraternity of Titus, and fetial priest.</p>

<p class="p8" style="display:none"><strong>8.</strong> Patriciorum numerum auxi consul quintum iussu populi et senatus. Senatum ter legi. Et in consulatu sexto censum populi conlega M. Agrippa egi. Lustrum post annum alterum et quadragensimum feci, quo lustro civium Romanorum censa sunt capita quadragiens centum millia et sexagiinta tria millia. Tum iterum consulari com imperio lustrum solus feci C. Censorino et C. Asinio cos, quo lustro censa sunt civium Romanorum capita quadragiens centum millia et ducenta triginta tria millia. Et tertium consulari cum imperio lustrum conlega Tib. Caesare filio meo feci, Sex. Pompeio et Sex. Appuleio cos, quo lustro censa suntcivium Romanorum capitum quadragiens centum millia et nongenta triginta et septem millia. Legibus novis me auctore latis multa exempla maiorum exolescentia iam ex nostro saeculo reduxi et ipse multarum rerum exempla imitanda posteris tradidi.</p>

<p class="p8" style="display:none"><strong>8.</strong> In my fifth consulship, I increased the number of patricians according to the whishes of the people and senate. I purged the senate three times, and in my sixth consulate [28 B.C.E.] I carried out a census of the people with Marcus Agrippa as my colleague. I conducted a <i>lustrum</i>, after a forty-one year, in which 4,063,000 Roman citizens were counted. Then again, with consular imperium and alone I conducted a lustrum in the consulship of Gaius Censorinus and Gaius Asinius; at that <i>lustrum</i> 4,233,000 Romans citizens were counted. And the third time, with consular <i>imperium</i>, I conducted a lustrum with my son Tiberius Caesar as colleague, in the consulship of Sextus Pompeius and Sextus Appuleius [14 C.E.], on that occasion 4,937,000 Roman citizens were registred. By new laws passed with my sponsorship, I restored many traditions of the ancestors, which were falling into disuse in our age, and myself I handed down many exemplary practices to posterity that they be imitated.</p>

<p class="p9" style="display:none"><strong>9.</strong>Vota pro valetudine meo suscipi per consules et sacerdotes quino quoque anno senatus decrevit. Ex iis votis saepe fecerunt vivo me ludos aliquotiens sacerdotum quattuor amplissima collegia, aliquotiens consules. Privatim etiam et municipatim universi cives unanimiter continenter apud omnia pulvinaria pro valetudine mea supplicaverunt.</p>

<p class="p9" style="display:none"><strong>9.</strong> The senate decreed that vows be undertaken for my health by the consuls and priests every fifth year. In fulfillment of these vows they often celebrated games during my lifetime; some times by the four highest colleges of priests, some times by the consuls. Moreover, both individually and on behalf of the city all the citizens unanimously and continuously prayed at all the <i>altars</i> (shrines) for my health.</p>

<p class="p10" style="display:none"><strong>10.</strong> Nomen meum senatus consulto inclusum est in saliare carmen et sacrosanctus in perpetum ut essem et, quoad ivierem, tribunicia potestas mihi esse, per legem sanctum est. Pontifex maximus ne fierem in vivi conlegae locum, populo id sacerdotium deferente mihi, quod pater meus habuerat, recusavi. Quod sacerdotium aliquod post annos, eo mortuo qui civilis motus occasione occupaverat, cuncta ex Italia ad comitia meaconfluente multitudine, quanta Romae nunquam fertur ante id tempus fuisse, recepi P. Sulpicio C. Valgio consulibus.</p>

<p class="p10" style="display:none"><strong>10.</strong> By a senate decree my name was included in the Hymn of the Salii, and it was established by law, both that I would be sacrosanct for ever, and that, as long as I would live, the tribunician power would be mine. I declined to be <i>pontifex maximus</i>, in the place a colleague of mine stil alive, though it was the people that offered me that priesthood which my father had held. And I received this priesthood, after several years, in the consulship of Publius Sulpicius and Gaius Valgius (12 B.C.E.), with the death of the man who had taken the opportunity of the civil disturbance to occupy the office, with a multitude flocking together out of all Italy to my election, so many as had never before seen in Rome.</p>

<p class="p11" style="display:none"><strong>11.</strong> Aram Fortunae Reducis ante aedes Honoris
et Virtutis ad portam Capenam pro reditu meo senatus consacravit, in qua pontifices et virgines Vestales
anniversarium  sacrificium facere decrevit eo die quo consulibus Q. Lucretio et M. Vinicio in urbem ex Syria redieram, et diem Augustalia ex cognomine nostro appellavit.</p>

<p class="p11" style="display:none"><strong>11.</strong> The senate consacrated the altar of Fortuna Redux in front of the temples of Honour and Virtue at the Porta Capena in honour of my return, and it ordered the priests and Vestal virgins to make an annual sacrifice there on the anniversary of my return to the city from Syria, in the consulship of Quintus Lucretius and Marcus Vinicius, and it named the day Augustalia after my <i>cognomen</i>.</p>

<p class="p12" style="display:none"><strong>12.</strong>  Senatus consulto ea occasione pars praetorum et tribunorum plebi cum consule Q. Lucretio et principi bus viris obviam mihi missa est in Campaniam, quo honos ad hoc tempus nemini praeter me est decretus. Cum ex Hisania Galliaque, rebus in iis provincis prospere gestis, Romam redi Ti. Nerone P. Quintilio consulibus, ~aram Pacis Augustae senatus proreditu meo consacrandam censuit ad campam Martium, in qua magistratus et sacerdotes et virgines Vestales anniversarium sacrificium facere decrevit.»</p>

<p class="p12" style="display:none"><strong>12.</strong> By the authority of the senate, some of the praetors and tribunes of the plebs, with consul Quintus Lucretius and the leading men, were sent to meet me in Campania, and honour that up until that time had been decreed for no-one but me. When I returned to Rome from Spain and Gaul, having successfully accomplished deeds in those provinces, in the consulship of Tiberius Nero and Publius Quintilius, the senate decreed that an altar of Augustan Peace should be consecrated.</p>

<p class="p13" style="display:none"><strong>13.</strong> Ianum Quirinum, quem clausum esse maiores
nostri voluerunt, cum per totum imperium populi Romani terra marique esset parta victoriis pax, cum prius quam nascerer, a condita urbe bis omnino clausum fuisse prodatur memoriae, ter me principe senatus claudendum esse censuit.</p>

<p class="p13" style="display:none"><strong>13.</strong> It was the will of our ancestors that the gateway of Janus Quirinus should be shut when victories had secured peace by land and sea throughout the whole empire of the Roman people; from the foundation of the city down to my birth, tradition records that it was shut only twice, but in my principate the senate resolved that it should be shut on three occasions.</p>

<p class="p14" style="display:none"><strong>14.</strong> Filios meos, quos iuvenes mihi eripuit
fortuna, Gaium et Lucium Caesares, honoris mei causa senatus populusque Romanus annum quintum et decimum agentis consules designavit, ut eum magistratum inirent post quinquennium. Et ex eo die, quo deducti sunt in forum ut interessent consiliis publicis decrevit senatus. Equites autem Romani universi principem iuventutis utrumque eorum parmis et hastis argenteis donatum appellaverunt.</p>

<p class="p14" style="display:none"><strong>14.</strong> When my sons, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, whom fortune snatched away from me as youths,  the senate and people of Rome appointed them as consuls at the age fourteen as a way of honoring me, so that they would enter the magistracy after five years. And the sanate decreed that on that day when they were led into the forum they would become part of public councils. Moreover, the Romans knights together, named each of them Prince of the youth and gave them silver shields and spears.</p>
