<p class="p15" style="display:block"><strong>15.</strong> Plebei Romanae viritum HS trecenos numeravi ex testamento patris mei. et nomine meo HS quadringenos ex bellorum manibiis consul quintum dedi, iterum autem in consulatu decimo ex patrimonio meo HS quadringenos congiari viritim pernumer[a]vi, et consul undecimum duodecim frumentationes frumento privatim coempto emensus sum. ~ et tribunicia potestate duodecimum quadringenos nummos tertium viritim dedi. Quae mea congiaria p[e]rvenerunt ad [homi]num millia nunquam minus quinquaginta et ducenta. Tribuniciae potestatis duodevicensimum consul XII trecentis et viginti millibus plebis urbanae sexagenos denarios viritim dedi. Et colon[i]s militum meorum consul quintum ex manibiis viritim millia nummum singula dedi. acceperunt id triumphale congiarium in colonis hominum circiter centum et viginti millia. Consul tertium dec[i]mum sexagenos denarios plebei, quae tum frumentum publicum acciebat, dedi; ea millia hominum paullo plura quam ducenta fuerunt.</p>

<p class="p15" style="display:block"><strong>15.</strong> To the plebs of Rome I paid outthree hundred sesterces each in accordance with the testament of my father, and in my own name I gave four hundred sesterces out of the plunder from warfare, when I was consul for the fifth time [29 BC]; then again, during my tenth consulate [24 BC], out of my personal assets I paid out four hundred sesterces each as a handout, and as consul for the eleventh time [23 BC] I bought up wheat at my expenses and made twelve grain doles, and in my twelfth year of tribunician power [12-11 B.C.], I gave four hundred sesterces per man for the third time. These doles of mine never reached fewer than two hundred and fifty thousand men. When I covered the tribunal power for the eighteenth time and I was consul for the twelfth time [5BC] I gave sixty deniers a head to three hundred and twenty thousand members of the urban plebs. And to the settlers who had been my soldiers, when I was consul for the fifth time, I distributed a thousand sesterces each out of plunder; in the colonies they received this handout to mark my triumphs about one hundred and twenty thousand men. As a consul for the thirteenth time [2 BC] I gave sixty denarii each to the plebe who at that time were in receipt of public wheat: they were a few more than two hundred thousand men.</p>
 
<p class="p16" style="display:none"><strong>16.</strong> Pecuniam [pr]o agris, quos in consulatu meo quarto et postea consulibus M. Cr[a]ssao et Cn. Lentulo augure adsignavi militibus, soliv municipis. Ea [s]u[mma s]estertium circiter sexsiens milliens fuit, quam [p]ro Italicis praedis numeravi. et ci[r]citer bis mill[ie]ns et sescentiens, quod pro agris provincialibus soliv. Id primus et [s]olus omnium, qui [d]eduxerunt colonias militum in Italia aut in provincis, ad memoriam aetatis meae feci. Et postea Ti. Nerone et Cn. Pisone consulibus, et D.Laelio cos., et C. Calvisio et L. Pasieno consulibus, et L. Le[nt]ulo et M. Messalla consulibus, et L.Caninio et Q. Fabricio co[s.], milit[i]bus, quos emeriteis stipendis in sua municipi[a dedux]i, praem[i]a numerato persolvi. ~ quam in rem sestertium q[uater m]illiens cir[cite]r impendi.</p>
 
<p class="p16" style="display:none"><strong>16.</strong> To the municipal town I paid money for the lands which I assigned to soldiers in my own fourth consulship and afterwards in the consulship of Marcus Crassus and Gnaeus Lentulus the augur. The sum which I paid for estates in Italy was about six hundred million sesterces, and the amount which I paid for lands in the provinces was about two hundred and sixty million. I was the first and only one to do this of all those who up to my time settle colonies of soldiers in Italy or in the provinces. And later, in the consulship of Tiberius Nero and Gnaeus Piso [7 BC], likewise in the consulship of Gaius Antistius and Decimus Laelius [6 BC], and in the consulship of Gaius Calvisius and Lucius Pasienus [4 BC], and in the consulship Lucius Lentulus adn Marcus Messalla [3 Bc], and in the consulship of Lucius Caninius and Quintus Fabricius [2 BC], I paid cash gratuities to the soldiers whom I settled in their own towns at the expiration of their service, and for this purpose I expended four hundred million sesterces as an act of grace.</p>
 

 
<p class="p17" style="display:none"><strong>17.</strong> Quater [pe]cunia mea iuvi aerarium, ita ut sestertium milliens et quing[en]ties ad eos qui praerant aerario detulerim. Et M. Lepido et L. Ar[r]untio cos. in aerarium militare, quod ex consilio n[eo] co[ns]titutum est, ex [q]uo praemia darentur militibus, qui vicena [aut plu]ra sti[pendi]a emeruissent â€” HS milliens et septing[e]nti[ens ex pa]t[rim]onio [m]eo detuli </p>


<p class="p17" style="display:none"><strong>17.</strong> Four times I aided the public treasury with my own money, paying out in this manner to those in charge of the treasury one hundred and fifty million sesterces. And in the consulship of Marcus Lepidus and Lucius Arruntius I contributed one hundred and seventy million sesterces out of my assets to the military treasury, which was estrablished on my advice that from it gratuities might be paid to soldiers who had seen twenty or more years of service.</p>

<p class="p18" style="display:none"><strong>18.</strong> Ab eo anno q]uo Cn. et P. Lentuli c[ons]ules fuerunt, cum deficerent [vecti]g[alia, tum] centum millibus h[omi]num, tum pluribus multo frume[ntarios et n]umma[rio]s t[ributus ex horr]eo et patr[i]monio m[e]o edidi.</p>

<p class="p18" style="display:none"><strong>18.</strong> From the year in which Gnaeus and Publius Lentulus were consuls [18 BC], whenever public revenues were lacking, I gave out distributions of grain and money from my own granary and assets, sometimes to 100,000 men, sometime to many more.</p>


<p class="p19" style="display:none"><strong>19.</strong> Curiam et continens ei Chalcidicum templumque Apollinis in Palatio cum porticibus, aedem divi Iuli, Lupercal, porticum ad circum Flaminium, quam sum appellari passus ex nomine eius qui priorem eodem in solo fecerat Octaviam, pulvinar ad circum maximum, aedes in Capitolio Iovis Feretri et Iovis Tonantis, ~ aedem Quirini, aedes Minervae et Iunonis reginae et Iovis Libertatis in Aventino, aedem Larum in summa sacra via, aedem deum Penatium in Velia, aedem Iuventatis, aedem Matris Magnae in Palatio feci. </p>

<p class="p19" style="display:none"><strong>19.</strong> I built the curia and the <i>Chalcidicum</i> adjoining it, the temple of Apollo on the Palatine with its porticoes, the temple of the deified Julius, the Lupercal, the portico at the Circus Flaminius which I allowed to be called Octavia after the name of him who ha constructed  an earlier one on the same site, the <i>pulvinar</i> at the <i>Circus Maximus</i>, the temples on the Capitol of Jupiter Feretrius and of Jupiter the Thunderer, the temple of Quirinus, the temples of Minerva and of Queen Juno and of Jupiter Libertas on the Aventine, the temple of the <i>Lares</i> at the top of the Sacred Way, the temple of the <i>Penates</i> on the Velia, the temple of Youth and the temple of the Great Mother on the Palatine.</p>

<p class="p20" style="display:none"><strong>20.</strong> Capitolium et Pompeium theatrum utrumque opus impensa grandi refeci sine ulla inscriptione nominis mei. Rovos aquarum compluribus locis vetustate labentes refeci, ~ et aquam quae Marcia appellatur duplicavi fonte novo in rivum eius inmisso. Forum Iulium et basilicam quae fuit inter aedem Castoris et aedem Saturni, ~ coepta profligataque poera a patre meo, perfeci, et eandem basilicam consumptam incendio ampliato eius solo sub titulo nominis filiorum m[eorum i]ncohavi, et, si vivus non perfecissem, perfici ab heredibus [meis ius]si. Duo et octoginta templa deum in urbe consul sextum ex [auctori]tate senatus refeci, nullo praetermisso quod e[o] tempore [refici debeba]t. Consul septimum viam Flaminiam a[b urbe] Ari[minum refeci pontes]que omnes praeter Mulvium et Minucium.</p>


<p class="p20" style="display:none"><strong>20.</strong> I restored the Capitolium and the theatr of Pompey both works incurring great expense without any inscription of my name . I resored the channels of the aqueducts which in several places were falling into disrepair through old age, and doubled the capacity of the aqueduct called the Marcia by turning a new spring into its channel. I completed the Julian Forum, and the basilica which was between the temple of Castor and the temple of Saturn, works begun and far advanced by my father, and when the same basilica was destroyed by fire I began its reconstruction on an enlarged site, to be inscribed with the name of my sons, and ordered that in case I should not live to complete it, it should be completed by my heirs. In my sixth consulship, in accordance with a decree of the senate, I restored in the city eighty-two temples of the gods, omitting none which at that time stood in need of repair. As consul for the seventh time I constructed the Via Flaminia form the city to Ariminum, and all the bridges except the Mulvian and the Minuncian.</p>


<p class="p21" style="display:none"><strong>21.</strong> In privato solo Martis Ultoris templum [f]orumque Augustum [ex ma]n[i]biis feci. Theatrum ad aede Apollinis in solo magna ex parte a p[r]i[v]atis empto feci, quod sub nomine M. Marcell[i] generi mei esset. Don[a e]x manibiis in Capitolio et in aede divi Iu[l]i et in aede Apollinis et in aede Vestae et in templo Martis Ultoris consecravi, quae mihi constiterunt HS circiter milliens. Auri coronari pondo triginta et quinque millia municipiis et colonis Italiae conferentibus ad triumpho[s] meos quintum consul remisi, et postea, quotienscumque imperator a[ppe]llatus sum, aurum coronarium non accepi, decernentibus municipii[s] et colonis aequ[e] beni[g]ne adque antea decreverant.</p>

<p class="p21" style="display:none"><strong>21.</strong> On private ground I built the temple of Mars Ultor and the Augustan Forum form the spoils of war. ON ground purchased for the most part private owners I built the theatre near the temple of Apollo which was to bear the name of my son-in-law Marcus Marcellus. From the spoils of war I consecrated offering on the Capitol, and in the temple of the divine Julius, and in the temple of Apollo, and in the temple of Vesta, and in the temple of Mars Ulto, which cost me about one hundred million sesterces. In my fifth consulship I remitted thirty-five thousand pound weight of crown-gold, and later, whenerever I was hailed as victorious general I did not take the offers of a crown, even though the citizen-town and colonies voted for it with the same eagerness as before. </p>

<p class="p22" style="display:none"><strong>22.</strong> Munus gladiatorium dedi meo nomine et quinquiens filiorum meorum aut n[e]potum nomine; quibus muneribus depugnaverunt hominum circiter decem millia. Bis athletarum undique accitorum spectaculu[m] p[o]pulo pra[ebui meo nomine et tertium nepo[tis] mei nomine. Ludos feci m[eo no]m[ine] quater, aliorum autem magistratuum vicem ter et viciens. Pro conlegio Xvvirorum magis[ter con]legii collega M. Agrippa ludos saeclares, C. Furnio C.Silano cos. [feci. C]onsul XIII ludos Mar[tia]les primus feci, quos post id tempus deincep[s] ins[equen]ti[bus] annis [ex senatus consulto et lege fecerunt consules. Venation[es] best[ia]rum Africanarum meo nomine aut filio[ru]m meorum et nepotum in circo aut in foro aut in amphitheatris, popul[o d]edi sexiens et viciens, quibus confecta sunt bestiarum circiter tria m[ill]ia et quingentae.</p>

<p class="p22" style="display:none"><strong>22.</strong> Three time in my own name I gave a show of gladiators, and five times in the name of my sons of grandsons; in these shows there fought about ten thousand men. Twice in my own name I furnished for the people an exhibition of athletes gathered from all parts of the world, and a third time in the name of my grandsosn. Four times I gave games in my own name; and also on behalf of other other magistrates twenty-three times. For the college of quindecemvirs, as master of that college and with Marcus Agrippa as my colleague, I provided the Secular Games in the consulship of Gaius Furnius and Marcus Silanus. In my thirteenth consulship [2 BC], I gave, for the first time, the games of Mars, which, since that time, the consuls by decree of the senate have provided in successive years. I gave to the people hunting shows of African wild beasts in my own name or in the name of my sons and grandsons in the circus or formu or amphitheatre twenty-six times; in which about three thousand five hundred beasts were slain.</p>

<p class="p23" style="display:none"><strong>23.</strong> Navalis proeli spectaclum populo de[di tr]ans Tiberim, in quo loco nunc nemus est Caesarum, avato [s]olo in longitudinem mille et octingentos pedes ~ in latudine[m mille] e[t] ducenti. In quo triginta rostratae naves triremes a[ut birem]es ~ plures autem minores inter se conflixerunt. Q[uibu]s in classibus pugnaverunt praeter remiges millia ho[minum tr]ia circiter.</p>

<p class="p23" style="display:none"><strong>23.</strong> I gave to the people the spectacle of a naval battle, in the place on the other side of the Tiber which is now the grove of the Caesars, the ground having been excavated for a lenght of eighteen hundred and a breadth of twelve hundred feet. In this spectacle thirty beaked ships, triremes or biremes and a large number of smaller vessels mete in conflict. In these fleets there fought about three thousand men besides the rowers.</p>

<p class="p24" style="display:none"><strong>24.</strong> In templis omnium civitatium prov[inci]ae Asiae victor ornamenta reposui, quae spoliatis templis is cum quo bellum gesseram privatim possederat. Statuae [mea]e pedestres et equestres et in quadrigeis argenteae steterunt in urbe XXC circiter, quas ipse sustuli ~ exque ea pecunia dona aurea in aede Apollinis meo nomine et illorum, qui mihi statuarum honorem habuerunt, posui.</p>

<p class="p24" style="display:none"><strong>24.</strong> As victor, I replaced in the temples of all the cities in the province of Asia the ornaments which the man against whom I had waged war had held in his private possession after plundering the temples. Silver statue of me, on foot, on horsebacj, and in chariots were erected in the city to the number of about eighty; these I myself removed, and from the money thus obtained I placed in the temple of Apollo golden offerings in my own name and in the name of those who had paid me the honour of a statute.</p>
