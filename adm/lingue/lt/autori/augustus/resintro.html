<h1>Res Gestae from the Monumentum Ancyranum</h1>

<p><b>Res Gestae Divi Augusti</b>, that is "The Deeds of the Divine Augustus", is a report written by the same Roman emperor Augustus just before his death in 14 AD, concerning the works he performed during his long political career. The original, which has not survived, was engraved upon a pair of bronze pillars and placed in front of Augustus' mausoleum on the Campus Martius in Rome. Many copies of the text were made and carved in stone on monuments or temples throughout the Roman Empire, some of which have survived; most notably, almost a full copy, written in the original Latin and a Greek translation was preserved on a temple to Augustus in Ancyra (the Monumentum Ancyranum of Ankara, Turkey); others have been found at Apollonia and Antioch, both in Pisidia. </p>

<p>A copy of the text can now be seen outside the Ara Pacis museum in the city of Rome (just opposite the mausoleum where it was originally displayed). </p>

<p>The copy preserved at Ankara begins by differentiating itself from the original at Rome:</p>
