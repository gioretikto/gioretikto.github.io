<h1>Syllables</h1>

<p>A <b>syllable</b> consists of one or more elementary sounds uttered in one emission of voice. There are some basic rules for dividing a word into syllables.</p>

<ol>

<li><p>A latin word has many syllables as it has vowels and dipthongs.</p>
<p>a-gi-ta-tus, a-ma-re, ae-tas, poe-na, Cae-sar</p>
</li>

<li><p>In dividing a word into syllables, a consonant after a vowel goes with the following syllable:</p>

<p>re-cta, ho-mi-nes</p>

</li>

<li><p>When a vowel or dipthongs is followed by two consonants, the first consonant goes with the first syllable, the second with the next syllable:</p>

<p>co<b>r</b>-<b>t</b>ex</p>
</li>

<li><p>A special case of double consonants concerns the combination of a mute (<i>b, p, c, g, d, t</i>) or a <i>f</i> followed by a liquid (<i>l, r</i>). In this case both consonants belong to the same syllable, as in:</p>

<p>ma-<b>tr</b>es</p>
<p>di-<b>pl</b>o-ma</p>
<p>in-<b>frĕ-</b>quens</p>
</li>

<li><p>If there are three consecutive consonants, the first two belong to the syllable before, and the third to the syllable that follows.</p></li>

<p>ma-gi<b>st</b>-<b>r</b>a</p>
<p>te<b>mp</b>-<b>l</b>um</p>

</li>

<li><p>The groups <b>qu</b> and <b>gu</b>, represent single consonant sounds, /ku/, /gw/, though written as two letters (<i>u</i> is not a stand-alone vowel, but represent a single grapheme with q- and -g);</p>

<ul>
<li><p><i>antiquum</i>, "old" is a word of three syllables an-ti-<b>qu</b>um.</p></li>
<li><p><i>sán-<b>gu</b>is</i>, «blood»</p></li>
</ul>

</li>

<li><p>In compound words formed by prefixing prepositions, this latter makes a distinct syllable, as in:</p>

<p><i>adiuvare</i>, is divided in ad-iu-va-re</p>
<p><i>abavus</i>, is divided in ab-a-vus</p>
<p><i>ades</i>, ad-est</p>
<p><i>ineo</i>, in-e-o</p>
<p><i>subigo</i>,  sub-igo</p>

<p>Also suffixes liek <i>-tus, -si</i> and <i>-ti</i> make distinct syllables as in:</p>

<p><i>scripsi</i>, scrip-si</p>
<p><i>doctus</i>, doc-tus</p>
<p><i>hostis</i>, hos-ti-s</p>
<p><i>testis</i>, tes-ti-s</p>
</li>

<li><p>The <b>semivowel i</b> is found either as an initial of a word before a vowel e.g. Iuno, Iupiter; or within the word and inter-vowe position, as in <i>eiuro, peiuro</i>. Sometimes it is written with the distinctive sign 'J'. It has an intermediate sound between a vowel and a consonant and for this must not be regarded as a syllable by itself, but it makes a syllable with the following vowel: Iu-no</p></li>

</ol>

<p>A syllable ending with a vowel or diphthong is called <b>open</b>; all others are called <b>closed</b>. Thus in ma-ter the first syllable is <i>open</i>, the second <i>closed</i>.</p>

<h2>Quantity of Syllables</h2>

<p>The quantitaty of a syllable is the time occupied in pronouncing it. The latin syllable can be</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>short</b>, when it contains a short vowel, marked by a ˘; thus ǎmor (love) has the <i>a</i> short.</p></li>
<li><p><b>long</b>, double the length of a short one when it contains a long vowel or diphthong; a long vowel has the mark ⁻ over it as in <i>māter</i>;</p></li>
<li><p><b>ancipital</b> (being two-headed or two-edged), when it can be either long or short; marked by a <img class="inline" src="img/ancipital.png" alt="ancipital sing"/> - as in <i>mihī̆, tibī̆, sibī̆, ibī̆, ubī̆</i></p></li>
</ul>


<p>The Quantity of the Syllable is important for the position of the <a href="accent.html">accent</a> and in versification. </p>

<p>A syllable is long, by <b>nature</b> (i.e., by the natural length of its vowel) or by <b>position</b> (i.e. when its vowel is followed by two or more consonants). Thus <i>fūr</i> and <i>mā-ter</i> have <i>u</i> and <i>a</i> long by nature. While <i>fāx</i> and amabūnt have <i>a</i> and <i>u</i> long by position (<i>x</i> is a double consonant).</p></li>

<p>The are some basic rules governing the quantity of a syllable:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>A closed syllable is always long- in <b>lēc</b>-tus, <i>lec</i> is long.</p></li>

<li><p>A syllable  is always <i>long by nature</i> if it has a long vowel or a diphthong. Dipthongs are contracted syllables and are always long. </p>

<p>aedēs, coelum</p></li>

<li><p>One vowel immediately followed by another is short- as <i>rĕus</i>, <i>dĕus</i>, <i>urcĕus</i>, .</p></li>

<li><p>A syllable containing a short vowel followed by two consonants (except a mute before <i>l</i> or <i>r</i>) or by a double consonant (<i>x, z</i>) is said to be <i>long by position</i>, but the vowel is pronounced short.</p>

<p><i>cǎptus</i>, has <i>a</i> short by nature but the syllable is long by position because the vowel is folowed by two consonants.</p></li>

<p><i>fǎctus</i>, has <i>a</i> short by nature but the syllable <i>fac</i> is long by position.</p></li>

<p><i>li-ber-tas</i>, has <i>e</i> short by nature but the syllable <i>ber</i> is long by position</p></li>

<li><p>A vowel is shortened before a vowel', <i>vocalis ante vocalem corripitur</i>, as in: <i>audio</i>, "I hear", that becomes <i>audīre</i>, "to listen".</p></li>

<li><p>Monosyllabic nouns ending in a consonant are long as: sōl, fūr, iūs, but all the other monosyllabic conjunction and pronouns are short as: ĕt, ut, in, ad, sĕd, quis, quot as well as the enclitic particles: quĕ, vĕ, sĕ, nĕ, tĕ, psĕ, ptĕ.</p></li>

<li><p>The vowels of radical syllables retain their natural quantity in derivative and compound words:</p>

<p>ămor, ămābĭlis, ĭnămābĭlis, ămīcĭtĭa.</p>
<p>māter, māternus</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>When a consonant is doubled the pronunciation should show this distinctly. Thus in transmitto both <i>Ts</i> should be pronounced as in out-talk and not merely a single <i>t</i> as in the english <i>letter</i>.</p>
