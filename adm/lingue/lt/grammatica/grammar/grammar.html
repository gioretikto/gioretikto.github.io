<h1>Grammar</h1>

<p>Grammar (from ancient greek γραμματική, grammatikè) is the set of rules governing the constituent elements of a language, and is part of the general study of language called linguistics.</p>

<p>It is not possible to specify precisely the various phases that led to the establishment of the parts of speech, the theory of declination and conjugation, but we can track some fundamental turning points.</p>

<p>The analysis of the individual parts of the speech in relation to their logical function is found already sketched in Plato in the V century BC; it was then continued by Aristotle (4th century BC), which founded the theory of grammatical forms, and from Chrysippus (III century BC) one of the greatest of the Stoics, much of his terminology has become a permanent part of the grammarian's vocabulary and had a direct influence on grammatical and literary studies of Rome. It was a Stoic emissary Crates who first introduced the study of grammar into Rome.</p>

<p>Roman grammar has its first main representative in the polymath Marcus Terentius Varro (116-27 B.C.), whose treatise <i>De lingua Latina</i>, ('On the Latin language') of which only six of 25 books have survived, and these are neither complete nor free of textual corruption, represents the most elaborate example of not only classical etymological grammar but also the way in which Stoic principles were woven into formalized grammatical discourse. This treatise represent the first in Latin on the Latin language. In this treatise special attention was paid to morphology in particular to the analysis of the Latin tense system and the Latin case system as constrasted with the Greek one. With the decline of the Roman empire, grammarians kept the Latin literary language alive now widespread throughout Europe.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages the grammar was considered the foundation of the whole culture; it was  Varro, who ranked grammar as the first of the liberal arts, (from liberalis "free") referred to the education of free men who were in that day citizens and not slaves and thus had the necessary leisure time to study: grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music.</p>

<p>Generally the term "grammar" means the normative type, that describes and lays down the various linguistic standards for practical teaching purposes. In modern era, alongside this type of grammar other forms have emerged: the <i>descriptive</i> grammar (or synchronic), which describes the grammar at a particular time; whereas a <i>diachronic</i> or <i>historical</i> grammar studies the evolution of a tongue following its development from the origins; <i>comparative grammar</i>, which makes a comparison in front of several languages ​​of the same family.</p>

<p>The grammar is divided into <i>phonetics, morphology and syntax</i>. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Phonetics</b> studies the sounds of the language, that is their origin, the laws that regulate them, and their changes.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Morphology</b> studies the inflection of words, their composition and derivation, the
determination of grammatical categories and formative elements, affixed and desinences, added to the radical part. For example, <i>amabamus</i> is defined as a trans verb sitivo and is analyzed in the root vid-, which gives the meaning of "love"; in the suffix thematic <i>-a-</i>, which indicates the second conjugation to which the verb belongs; the affix <i>-ba-</i>, is characteristic of the indicative imperfect; in the ending <i>-mus</i>, which indicates the first active plural person: "we loved".</p></li>

<li><p><b>The syntax</b> studies the structure of the sentence, the elements that compose it and the processes that formally express the relationships between these elements either in the context of a single proposition, or in the complex of several propositions constituting a period. The Latin syntax in particular is then subdivided into syntax of cases, syntax of the verb and syntax of the period.</p></li>
