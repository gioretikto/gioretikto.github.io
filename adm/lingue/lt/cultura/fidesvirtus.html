<p>Pietas, honos, virtus, concordia, pudicitia, clementia were not only values but deities with a temple or shrine in Rome.</p>

      <h1>Fides</h1>
<p>	"FIDES"  is often  (and wrongly)  translated  
'faith',  but it has nothing to do with the word as used by Christians 
writing in Latin about the Christian virute (St. Paul  <em>Letter to the Corinthians</em>,
  chapter 13). For the Romans,  FIDES  was an essential element in the 
character of a man of public affairs, and a necessary constituent 
element of all social and political transactions  (perhaps = 'good 
faith').  FIDES meant 'reliablilty', a sense of trust between two 
parties if a relationship between them was to exist.  FIDES was always 
reciprocal and mutual, and implied both privileges and responsibilities 
on both sides.  In both public and private life the violation of FIDES 
was considered a serious matter, with both legal and religious 
consequences.  FIDES, in fact, was one of the first of the 'virtues' to 
be considered an actual divinity at Rome.   The Romans had a saying, 
"Punica fides" (the reliability of a Carthaginian) which for them 
represented the highest degree of treachery:  the word of a Carthaginian
  (like 
Hannibal)  was not to be trusted, nor could a Carthaginian be relied on 
to maintain his political elationships.</p>

    <h2 class="titletext">VIRTUS</h2>
</div>
<blockquote><p >VIRTUS,  for the Roman,  does not carry the same overtones as the Christian  'virtue'. But like the Greek andreia, VIRTUS has a primary meaning of 'acting like a man' (<em>vir</em>)   [cf. the Renaissance virtù ),  and for the Romans this meant first and foremost 'acting like a brave man in military matters'. <em>virtus</em> was to be found in the context of 'outstanding deeds'  (<em>egregia facinora</em>),  and brave deeds were the accomplishments which brought  GLORIA ('a reputation').  This GLORIA  was attached to two ideas:  FAMA  ('what people think of you')  and  dignitas  ('one's standing in the community').  The struggle for  VIRTUS  at Rome was above all a struggle for public office  (honos), since it was through high office, to which one was elected by the People, that a man could best show hi smanliness which led to military achievement--which would lead in turn to a reputation and votes.  It was the duty of every aristocrat (and would-be aristocrat) to maintain the  <em>dignitas</em>  which his family had already achieved and to extend it to the greatest possible degree (through higher political office and military victories).  This system resulted in a strong built-in impetus in Roman society to engage in military expansion and conquest at all times.</p></blockquote>
