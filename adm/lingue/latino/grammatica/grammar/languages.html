<h1>Latin: an inflected language</h1>

<p>Numerous attempts have been made to classify languages ​​scientifically. The concept of "typology" in linguistic referst to the classification of languages according to theri structural features. A fundamental reference point is the studies of the brothers Schlegel, who divided the languages ​​into three groups.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Isolating languages:</b></br> These are languages ​​without grammatical structure .The main features of this group of languages ​​are <i>monosyllabism</i>, so each Syllable constitutes a basic phonetic unit, with a number of syllable-phonemes exactly limited, and <i>tone</i>, so that each syllable can be pronounced in different tones (generally from five to nine). An example of a language belonging to this group is Chinese and Vietnamese.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Agglutinating Languages,</b></br>
In an agglutinating language, a word may consist of several morphemes but the boundaries between them are neat. There is typically a direct correspondence between a morpheme and its meaning, and a morphene has an invariant shape which makes it easy to identify. Hungarian and Turkish are classical examples. A noun is easily separated into a lexical stem, a number affix and a case affix. For example in Hungarian <i>ember</i> means «man»; + plural suffix (-ek), emberek, «men»; +  suffix -nek): <i>embereknek</i>, means «to the men». This is the complete noun declension paradigm (you can skeep it for now) for <i>ember</i>, "man" is</p>

<table>
<theda>
<th></th> <th>Singular</th> <th>Plural</th>
</thead>

<thbody>
<tr><td>Nominative</td> <td>ember</td> <td>ember-ek</td></tr>

<tr><td>Dative</td> <td>ember-nek</td> <td>ember-ek-nek</td></tr>

<tr><td>Accusative</td> <td>ember-et</td> <td>ember-ek-et</td></tr>

<tr><td>Locative</td> <td>ember-ben</td> <td>ember-ek-ben</td></tr>

</thbody>
</table>

</p></li>

<li><p><b>Fusional</b> sometimes misleadinlgy called inflectional languages there is no cleare boundary between morphenes: thus in the declension of nouns, stem and affixes are "fused" together.</p>

<table>
<theda>
<th></th> <th>Singular</th> <th>Plural</th>
</thead>

<thbody>
<tr><td>Nominative</td> <td>den</td> <td>dni</td></tr>

<tr><td>Genitive</td> <td>dnja</td> <td>dnej</td></tr>

<tr><td>Dative</td> <td>dnju</td> <td>dnjam</td></tr>

<tr><td>Accusative</td> <td>den</td> <td>dni</td></tr>

<tr><td>Instrumental</td> <td>dnjom</td> <td>dnjami</td></tr>

<tr><td>Prepositional</td> <td>dne</td> <td>dnjax</td></tr>

</thbody>
</table>

<p>Unlike in Turkish, it is not possible to segment the genitive plural, into the [day] morpheme, and genitive morpheme. Moreover the "fleeting vowel" <i>e</i> in den eliminates the formal morphological invariability of the root morpheme and thus hinders the segmentability of words in the paradigm. Fusional languages also tend to encode more than one meaning into a single affix. For example in Russian a single affix -a added to a noun marks the the noun as having feminine gender, singular number, and subject function (In an agglutivative language, these three pieces of information would be indicated by three separete morphemes).</p> 

<li><p><b>Inflected Languages</b>,</br>The same words exists in a number of different forms each one having a variation of the final part, called the <i>ending</i>; The grammatical relations are indicated mainly by changes of the ending. These are the Indo-European languages, a family of languages ​​common in Asia and Europe, derived from a common linguistic lineage. Belong to this group the Indian, Iranian, Armenian, Albanian, Greek, Osco-Umbrian (who was spoken in south-central Italy), Celtic, Germanic, Balto-Slavic and the Latin, with the Romance languages ​​from it derived.</p>

<p>For example, in Latin by varying the terminal part of the word <i>rosa</i> ("The rose"), we can have <i>rosae</i>, which can mean "of the rose", "to the rose", "roses", "oh roses"; <i>rosam</i>, "the rose", direct object; <o>rosarum</i>, "of the roses", complement of specification; varying the ending of loving we can have bitters, "to be loved"; amas, "you love"; amamus, "we love"; amamur, "we are loved" etc. The inflection can be nominal, proper to names and adjectives; pronominal, proper of pronouns; verbal, proper to verbs.</p>

<p>The nominal and pronominal inflection is called <b>declension</b>.</p>
<p>The verbal inflection, is called <b>conjugation</b>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A modern language cannot be classifies neatly into any of the type presented above. English for examples falls between shares several of the 'inflecting', isolating and agglutinating characteristics as part of its basic words structure and sentence construction. It uses suffixes such as "-s" to express number or possession ("Paul's cat") and the "-ed" to express the past tense, but construct the future tense in an isolating way, through an auxiliary will.</p>
