<h1>The Cases</h1>
<p>Latin is an <i>inflected language</i>. Inflection is a change made in the form of a word to show the grammatical function performed by that word in a phrase, clause, or sentence.</p>

<p>In English the only case ending in nouns is that of the genitive (as
in man's, father's, etc.). Elsewhere the function of a noun is shown
by its position in a clause (the difference in meaning between "John kicked Paul" and "Paul kicked John" depends solely on word order) or by a preposition: the ball was kicked by John (here the part played by the subject is indicated by the preposition by).</p>

<p>Now compare the way in which English and Latin deal with the noun “boy”, "puer" in latin, in the following sentences:</p>
<p>Magister <b>pueri</b> amicus est - The teacher is a friend of the boy.</p>
<p>Magister librum <b>puero</b> dat - The teacher gives a book to the boy.</p>
<p>Magister monet <b>puerum</b>. -  The teacher reproaches the boy.</p>
<p>Magister <b>puerum</b> amat - The teacher loves the boy.</p>
<p>Magister a <b>puero</b> interfectus est - The teacher was killed by the boy.</p>
<p>Veni, <b>Puer!</b> disce Sapere. - Come Boy! learn to be wise.</p>

<p>In each of these sentences, the noun "boy" performs a different grammatical function. As you can see, in English the form of "boy" never changes. Instead, function is indicated either by word order or by the addition of a preposition (“to,” “by”) or, in the last sentence, by punctuation. <br> In Latin, by contrast, the form of the noun itself, not word order, indicates the function, usually without the addition of extra words. So you see different forms of “Puer” in these six sentences, depending on the noun's function in the sentence.</p>

<p>In a Latin sentence, each of the various functions performed by nouns, is associated with one of six <b>cases</b> each one having its own particular function. They are: nominative genitive, dative, accusative, vocative and ablative.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The <b>nominative</b> case expresses the subject of a sentence; i.e., the person or thing performing the action or under discussion. Tends to answer the question, "Who/what did it?". Some examples:</p>

<p>Bonus magister monet suous discipulos - The good teacher reproaches his pupils.</p>

<p>Magister is the subject, so in Latin it is in the nominative.</p>
      
        
<li><p>The <b>Genitive</b> case to express possession.</p>


<li><p>The <b>Dative</b> case that expresses the indirect object after verbs of giving and saying.; i.e it indicates a person or thing who is somehow interested in or affected by the action in some immediate way.
Consistently, the dative will be translated via the English prepositions "to" or "for."</p>

<p>Magister librum puero donat - The teacher gives a book as gift to the boy.</p>

<li><p>The <b>Accusative</b> is the case of the direct Object of a verb.</p>
<p>The tiger killed <b>the elephant</b>.</p>
<p>I eat <b>the salad</b>.</p>
<p>The accusative case expresses also the goal of motion — the person or thing towards which one is moving. It is usually introduced by the preposition <i>in</i> and <i>ad</i>: </p>
<p><i>Agricola <b>ad silvam</b> contendit</i> - "The Farmer heads toward the forest".</p>
<p><i><b>In</b> schola<b>m</b> venire</i> - "to go to school"</p>
<p><i><b>ad</b> Sicili<b>am</b> navigare</i> - to sail toward Sicily.</p>
<p><i><b>in</b> urbe<b>m</b> redire, to get back to town</p>

</li>

<li>The <b>Ablative</b> case in Latin has many functions, such as: <i>separation, location, instrument (or means) or accompaniment, difference or aversion</i>, and others functions we will study later on. It is generally introduced by the preposition <i>with, from, by, etc.</i>. Some example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Separation:</p>
<p>Ab insula navigamus  - We are sailing <b>from</b> the island.</p>
<p>ex Graeciā in Italiam nāvigāvērunt, They sailed <b>from</b> Greece to Italy</p>

<li><p>Location:</p>
<p>He is <b>in the house</b>.<br>
The pen is <b>on the table</b>.</br>
He slept <b>under the bench</b>.</p>
<p>A latin example:<br>
in silva - "in the forest"</p>
</li>

<li><p>Adverions/Difference:</p>
<p>Ab eo dissentio - I differ from him<br>
aliena a dignitate - it is foreign to my ways.</p>
</li>

<li><p>instrument (or means) or accompaniment</p>
<p>I can only draw with a pencil. (instrument/means)</br>
They hit me with a stick. (instrument/means)</br>
Caper cornu ferit. The goat hits with its horn (instrument/means)</br>
Milites gladis pugnat - The soldiers fight with swords (instrument/means)</br>
cum amīcīs vēnērunt - They came with friends (accompaniment)</br>
</p>


</ul>

<li>The <b>Vocative</b> is the case of Direct Address, used to address someone or something directly. It is often preeceded by <i>O</i> and generally followed by a mark of punctuation:</p>
<p>"I don't know, John" - John is a vocative expression.</p>
<p>O regina! - "Oh queen!"</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<p>All the cases, except the nominative and vocative, are used as object-cases; and are sometimes called Oblique Cases (Casus obliqui).</p>
