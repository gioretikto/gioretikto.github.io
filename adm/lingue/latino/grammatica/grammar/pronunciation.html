<h1>The Pronunciation of Latin</h1>

<p>The Latin language, spoken in the first millennium BC in a circumscribed area of Latium, spread throughout the ancient world with the expansion of the dominion of Rome. The idiom of the conquerors became a universal language, useful for communicating across the empire, as happens today with English. Latin literature began in the middle of the third century with the adaptation of Greek plays with drama the most predominat literary genre at Rome. We call the language of thi period <b>Early Latin</b>. Twenty plays of Plautus and six of Terence represent a mavellous take on the latin of this time. Terence developed a more literary form of Latin in anticipation of what we call <b>Classical latin</b> the language of poetry and formal prose writing used if the first century BC and most recognizable in the writings of Cicero and his contemporaries.</p>

<p>The slow and constant evolution in the centuries of this language, growing contininuosly apart from the formal Latin of literature and administration resulted into the <b>Vulgar Latin</b> (Latin of the <i>vulgus</i> or common people) which ultimately turned about A.D. 800 into the Romance languages: <b>french, spanish, romanian, portugues</b>, and <b>italian</b>.</p>

<p>However, even with the rise of these vernacular languages, Latin continued during Middle ages and later to be used as as Europe's lingua franca and remained the predominant language for cultural, intellectual, religious and scientific affairs. During middle ages there was a trendency for speakers across Europe to pronounce Latin as they would their own language;</p>

<section>

<p>In 1528, Erasmus of Rotterdam published his dialogue <i>De Recta Latini Graecique Sermonis Pronuntiatione</i> ("On the Correct Pronunciation of the Latin and Greek Language"), discussing mutually unintelligible national pronunciations of Latin strongly influenced by the vernacular languages, that often led to confusion. The following is an hilarious anedocted from Erasmus' dialogue, describing the Emperor Maximial I, listenining to some speeches of welcome from orators of various countries: <br> <br><i>"One of the speakers was a Frenchman and gave his speech in one discret Latin, but with a French accent so strong tha some  Italian scholars present thought he was speaking in French; such was the laughter that the Frenchman broke off his speech in embarrrassment, and began to search an orator answering him. But even more sonourus ridicule greeted the German accent of the next speaker; Then the speaker from Denmark whoreceived an answer from a Zelandese: but it could be said that neither one nor the other had spoken Latin"</i>.</p>

<p>Erasmus tried to reestablish Classical pronunciation and in his "De pronuntiatione," recognizes the Italian pronunciation to be closest to the original, though he had the conviction that "c" and "g" letters must once for "hard" guttural sounds notining that Germans retained the hard c, since they say <i>Kaiser</i> for Caesar. Erasmus' reform was met by storng opposition and in England, France and Germany. A new reformed pronunciation of Classical Latin formulated by various Cambridge and Oxford scholars emerged in the 1870s and became accepted by the beginning of the twentieth century - it is now known as <b>Classic</b> or <b>Restitūta</b> pronunciation, «restored», or also as <b>scientific</b> pronunciation. Among Roman Catholic circles and Italy - Latin is still pronounced accordinig to the pre-Erasmian system, know as <b>ecclesiatical pronounciation</b>.</p>

<h3>Diphthongs - Dipthonga</h3>

<p>Two vowels united can produce a dipthong, pronounced together in one <a href="syllable.html">syllable</a>. There are five diphtongs namely: <b>ae, oe, au, eu,</b> which are in common use and <b>ei, ui, yi</b>, which occur only a few words.</p>

<ul>

    <li><p><b>ae</b> as <i>i</i> in al<b>i</b>ve; Caesar </p></li>

    <li><p><b>au</b>, as ow in b<b>ow</b>; aurum</p></li>

    <li><p><b>ei</b>, as ey in H<b>ey</b></p></li>

    <li><p><b>oe</b>, line <i>oi</i> in b<b>oi</b>l;</p></li>

    <li><p><b>eu</b> in two syllable, as <i>ey</i> in <i>they</i> and <i>u</i> in <i>pu</i>t;</p></li>

    <li><p><b>ui</b>, as <i>wee</i>, or French <i>Oui</i>.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3>Consonants</h3>

<p>Consonanst are distinguished into mutes, semivowels, and liquids. The mutes cannot be sounded at all without the aid of a vowel. They are <i>b, p, d, t, k, q</i> and <i>c</i> and <i>g</i> hard. The semivowels can be imperfeclty sounded without a vowel as: <i>f, h, j, l, m, r, s, v, c</i> and <i>g</i> soft and the double consonants <i>x</i> and <i>z</i>. Four of these <i>l, m, n, r</i> are termed <i>liquids (liquidae)</i> for their smooth and flowing sound.</p>

<p>Besides these there are the guttural and dental aspirats <i>h</i> and <i>s</i>; 

<p>The consonants are also divided according to the principal organs by which they are pronounced, into:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>Labials(lip-sounds): b, p (ph), f, v, m;</p></li>
    <li><p>Dentals(tooth-sounds): d, t, (th), l, n, r, s;</p></li>
    <li><p>Gutturals (throat-sound): g, c, k, qu, (ch);</p></li>
</ul>

<img src="img/consonants.png" alt="consonants division latin"/>

<p>According to the way we articulate the consononants, we can distinguish three major groups:</p>

<p><b>Occlusive consonants</b> are determined by a closure of the vocal tract while articulating the sound. For example, while pronuncing the sound -p -b we do close the mouth completley for a moment. </p>

<p><b>Continuous consonants</b> do not imply the complete closure of the vocal tract.</p>

<h2>Pronunciation of Consonants</h2>

<p>There are no silent consonants in Latin and they are always pronounced as they are written. </p>

<p>In general consonants have the same sounds as in English with few exceptions that require particular attention.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The <b>c</b> is pronounced like the english <b>ch</b>ance before e, i, ae, or oe; otherwise always hard as in <b>c</b>at</p> and never as in <i>city</i>: <i>hac</i>, <i>consul</i>, <i>Caeser</i></p></li>

<b>ch</b>ance before e, i, ae, or oe; otherwise <i>k</i> as in <b>c</b>at</p></li>

<li><p>Also <b>ch</b> has always the sound of <i>k</i>, as <i>chorda, chorus, machina.</i></p></li><i>

<li><p><b>h</b> has not a proper sound but indicates a slight aspiration as in the english <i>hat</i>, <i>honor, horator, rhetor</i></p></li>

<p><b>ph</b>, p followed by h with slight aspiration</p>

<li><p><b>Q</b> occurs always before the vowel <i>u</i>, the two being pronounced as <i>kw</i>: aqua</p></li>

<li><p><b>s</b> has generally an hissing sound, as in the English <i>thus</i> and <i>soft<i>.</i></p></li>

<li><p><b>ti</b> like pa<b>ti</b>, never as "action"</p></li>

<li><p><b>v</b> is pronounced like <i>w</i> in <i>woman</i>.</p></li>

<li><p><b>z</b> is as <i>dz</i> in adze</p>

<li><p><b>X</b> at the beginning of a syllable, has the sound of a <i>z</i> as <i>xenium</i>; when located at the end of a syllable, that of <i>ks</i>, as in <i>axis</i>.</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Ecclesiatical pronunciation</h2>

<p>The sounds of consonants in Ecclesiastical pronunciation are mostly the same as
in Classical pronunciation. A few sounds soften somewhat, though, in the later Latin pronunciation, and there is a different pronunciation for the Diphthongs.</p>

<p>The diphtongs <b>ae, eo</b> are pronounced as an <i>e</i> so like the <i>e</i> in <i>b<b>e</b>t</i>.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><b>ae</b>tas, c<b>ae</b>lum</p></li>
    <li><p>f<b>oe</b>tidus.</p></li>
    <li><p>p<b>oe</b>na</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Consonants in the Ecclesiastical system</h3>

<ul>
    <li><p><b>c</b>, ch like 
    <li><b>g</b>, as <b>g</b>eniu before <i>e</i> or <i>i</i>; otherwise <i>g</i> as in <b>g</b>ood</p></li>
    <li><p><b>ph</b> as f:</p>
    <li><p><b>r</b> always thrilled</p></li>
    <li><p><b>t</b> is pronounced as pure <i>t</i> except for the group <b>ti</b> which is pronounced as /tzi/, Iustitia, like /justitzia/.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Classical Pronunciation of Latin</h2>

<p>The vowels were pronounced thus:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><b>a</b>, as <i>a </i> in <i>father</i> or in <i>far</i>.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>e</b>, as <i>e</i> in <i>bet</i> or <i>ay</i> in <i>bay</i>.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>i</b>, as <i>i</i> in <i>bin</i> or <i>ee</i> in <i>been</i>.</p>
    </li><li><p>The letters <b>i, j</b> when placed before another vowel, such as <i>iusto</i>, <i>ius</i>, are pronounced like the english consonant y (you).</p></li>
    <li><p><b>o</b>, as <i>o</i> in <i>done</i> or <i>dot</i>.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>u</b>, as <i>oo</i> in <i>boon</i> </p></li>
</ul>
