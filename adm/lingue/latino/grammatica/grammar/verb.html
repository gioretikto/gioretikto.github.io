<h1>Latin Verbal system</h1>

<p>The inflection of verbs is called <i>conjugation</i>. Fundamental elements in the study of the conjugation are the qualities that verb form exhibit:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>the <b>gender</b></p></li>
    <li><p>the <b>voice</b> (or <b>form</b>) and <b>diathesis</b></p></li>
    <li><p>the <b>mood</b></p></li>
    <li><p>the <b>number</b> and <b>person</b></p></li>
    <li><p>the <b>tense</b></p></li>
    <li><p>the <b>aspect</b></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>The gender</h2>

<p>In latin as in English, a <b>transitive</b> verb expresses action that is directed toward a <b>direct object</b>:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>Pater amat filiam - <i>The father loves his daughter</i></p></li>
</ul>

<p>An <b>intransitive</b> verb expresses an action that does not transit or move away from the subject:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><i>Aliquis venit - someone has arrived</i></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>The Voice</h2>

<p>The voice  or form of a verb describes the relationship between the action (or state) that the verb expresses and the participants identified by its arguments (subject, object, etc.). The voice of latin verbs can be active or passive:</p>

<p>A verb in the <b>active</b> voice has a subject which is doing the action:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>puellae <b>legunt</b> librum - <i>The girls read a book</i></p></li>
    <li><p>Regina puellae rosam <b>dat</b> - <i>The queen gives a rose to the girl</i></p></li>
    <li><p>canis <b>currit</b> -<i>the dog runs</i></p></li>
</ul>

<p>A verb in the <b>passive</b> voice has a subject toward which the action of the verb is done to it:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>Liber legĭtur a puellis- <i>the book is read by the girls</i></p></li>
    <li><p>Caesar a Bruto interfectus est - <i>Caesar was killed by Brutus</i></p></li>
</ul>

<p>It is possible to know the voice by looking at the terminaion of a verb; the active ending in <i>o</i>, and the passive in <i>or</i>. However the termination does not imply necessarily that verb would be active in meaning. There is a large class of verbs in Latin which only take passive forms. Surprisingly and uniquely, however, these verbs are not translated as passive, but rather, as active. That is, they are passive in form but active in meaning. Such deponent verbs exist in all four conjugations. For example there are verbs like <i>loquor</i>, "I speak", <i>venor</i>, "I hunt", vereor, "I fear", <i>sequor</i> "I follow". Moreover there are also verbs with an active form though passive in meaning; for examples the verbs <i>fio</i> "to be made", <i>pereo</i>, "to go missing", <i>veneo</i>, "to be sold", <i>vapulo</i> "to be".</p>

<p>For this reason it is important to make distinction between the concept of <i>voice</i> (the morphological form) and <b>diathesis</b>, the logical-semantic value of the verb.; from the greek διάϑεσις, "disposition", i.e. the disposition of the subject toward the action expressed by the verb. There are three kinds of diathesis:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><b>Active diathesis</b>: when the meaning expressed is active; it is equal to the active voice of the transitive and intransitive verbs except for deponent verbs.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>passive diathesis</b>: when the meaning expressed is passive; it is equal generally to the passive voice of intransitive verbs.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Middle diathesis</b> (or reflexive): when the action involves something moving into the sphere of the Subject or a reflexive action. It is typical of verbs like: <i>lavor</i>, "I wash myself", <i>obliviscor</i>, "I forget", <i>queror</i>, "I ", <i>recordo</i>, "I remember". The middle diathesis can be equivalent to the passive voice of some transitive verbs like: <i>cingor</i>, <i>feror</i>, <i>moveor</i>, "I move".</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Mood</h2>

<p>The mood is the manner in which the speaker or writer conceives the action. The moods are divided into finite and infinite. The finite verbs have certain fixed terminations indicating the person and number. The infinite verbs are not confined to one number or person. The are three finite moods in Latin: indicative, subjunctive and imperative. The infinite moods are the: infinitive, gerund, gerundive, participle and supine.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The <b>indicative</b> is the mood of <i>fact</i> and it is used for most <i>direct assertion</i> and <i>interrogations</i>:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p><i>Milites strenui <b>sunt</b> - The soldiers are brave</i></p></li>
            <li><p><i><b>Valēnse?</b> - <i>Are  you well?</i></p></li>
        </ul>
</li>

<li><p>The <b>Subjunctive</b> is the mood used to express <i>desire</i> or <i>wish</i>, a <i>purpose</i> or a <i>possibility</i>:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><i>Adsum ut <b>videam</b> - I am here to see (purpose)</i></p></li>
    <li><p><i>Gaudeam si absit - I shall be glad if he's absent (possibility)</i></p></li>
    <li><p><i>Fortis sia - May he be brave (wishing)</i></p></li>
</ul>    

</li>

<li><p>The <b>imperative</b> is used for <i>exhortation, entraty,</i> or <i>command</i>, in some cases the Subjunctive can be used instead.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><i><b>Impera</b> quidvis! - Order whatever you want!</i></p></li>
    <li><p><i>Quo me nunc vertam? (Cic.) - Where should turn to now?</i></p></li>
</ul>

</li>

<li><p>The <b>infinitive</b> is used chielfy as an indeclinable noun:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><p><i>Semel in anno licet <b>insanire</b> - It is allowed once in the year to be foul</i></p></li>
        <li><p><i>Humanum est <b>errare</b> - To err is human</i></p></li>
    </ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>The tensens of the verb</h2>

<p>Tensens (<i>Tempora</i> in latin) are forms indicating the <i>time</i> of action or state in verbs. Time admits a threfold division, into present, past and future; each of these times may be represented either as going on, or as completed. From these two division arise the six tenses of the Latin verb:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>Present</p></li>
    <li><p>Imperfect</p></li>
    <li><p>Future</p></li>
    <li><p>Perfect</p></li>
    <li><p>Pluperfect</p></li>
    <li><p>Future perfect tenses</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The <b>Present tense</b> represents an action as now going on, and not completed: <b>lego</b>, "I read" or "I am reading". Latin does not make any distinction between the simple, the progressive and the emphatic form of a verb so: <i>curro</i>, can mean "I run", "I am running", "I does run".</p>

<p>The <b>imperfect tense</b> (<i>"imperfectum"</i>, "not completed"), represents an action as going on at some past time, but not the completed, as: <b>audiebam</b>, "I was hearing".</p>

<p>The <b>Perfect tense</b> (<i>"perfectum"</i>, "completed") represents one of two types of action:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>An action as completed in the past time: <b>vinci</b>, "I won"</p></li>
    <li><p>An action as just completed, analogous to the English present perfect: <b>edi</b>, "I have eaten".</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The <b>Pluperfect tense</b> (<i>"plus quam perfectum"</i>, "more than completed") represents an action which was already completed at some time in the past: <b>amaveram</b>, "I had loved".</p>

<p>The <b>future</b>, indicates an action which will be completed before or at the time of some other future action: </p>

<ul>
    <li><p><i>Scribam - I shall write</i></p></li>
<ul>

<p>The <b>future perfect</b>, indicates an action which will occur at some later time: <b>edam</b>, "I shall eat".</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><i>Cum opus <b>perfecĕro</b>, ad te veniam - "When I'll ended the job, I'll come to you".</i></p></li>
    <li><p><i>Cum <b>cenaveĕro</b>, profiscar - "When I shall supdped the job, I'll go".</i></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Aspect</h2>

<p>Aspect is a grammatical category that expresses how an action, event, or state, denoted by a verb, extends over time. In Latin there are three different aspects:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>The <b>continuous aspect</b> shows an action while in progress:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li><p><i>Ternaque acies tempore uno locis diversis <b>pungabant</b>- "And three groups simultaneously were fighting in different places"</i></p></li>
            
            <li><p><i>Sedet in taberna -"He sits in a tavern"</i></p></li>
        </ul>   
    </li>
      
    <li><p>The <b>completed aspect</b> (or <i>perfect system</i>) refers to a single completed event with perduring effects:</p>
    
    <ul>        
        <li><p><i>Romani Ciceronem consulem creaverunt - The Romans elected Cicero consul</i></p></li>
    </ul>
    
    </li>
            
     <li><p>The <b>Absolute aspect</b> refers to the action unbounded in time, without giving the idea of conclusion or progression:</p>
     
     <ul>
     
        <li><p><i>Facile omnes, cum valemus, recta consilia aegrotis damus. (Ter.) - "We all find it easy to give the right advice to the sick when we are well"</i></p></li>

        <li><p><i>Non omnes arbusta iuvant humilesque myricae (Verg.) - "Orchards and humble tamarisks don't please everyone"</i></p></li>
     </ul>   
     </li>
     
</ul>
