<h1>The Degrees of adjectives</h1>

<p>Adjectives denote qualities, and the same quality existing in two different persons or things may be in a higher, lower degree in the one than in the other, but it can also be equal, or in the highest degree in one of them. Latin Adjectives vary in ending to express three degrees of quality as in the english <i>easy, easier, easiest</i>, or <i>good, better, best</i>. The first degree is called Positive; the second degree is called comparative; The third degree is called Superlative.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>The <b>Positive Degree</b> simply denotes a quality without any reference to other degrees of the same quality; as: <i>Bonus</i>, "good", <i>Malus</i>, "bad", <i>Magnus</i>, "great", <i>Parvus</i>, "small".</p> </li>
    
    <li><p>The <b>comparative deegree</b> denotes that one of two objects has a quality in a increased/lessened, or equal degree than the other;</p></li>

    <p><li>The <b>superlative deegree</b> denotes that one person or object has a quality in the highest degree: <i>vir omnium procerissimus</i> - the tallest man of all</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>comparative degree</i> can:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>increase the positive in meaning, this is called <b>comparative of superiority</b>; as: <i>better, wiser, greater, taller</i>. <i>Paulus altior quam Marcus est - «Paulus is taller than Marcus»</i></p></li>
    <li><p>lessen the positive in meaning, this is called <b>comparative of inferiority</b>; as: lower, less wise</i>. <i>Paulus minus altus quam Marcus est - «Paulus is smaller than Marcus»</i></p></li>
    <li><p>make a comparison between two object, persons, etc, two objects having equal degrees of quality; this is called <b>comparative of equality</b>; <i>Soror mea tam pulchra quam tu est - «My sister is as pretty as you»</i> </p>
</ul>

<p>The <i>superlative degree</i> increases, or lessens the positive to the highest or lowest degree as:<i>best, wisest, greatest, highest, lowest, least wise</i>.</p>
