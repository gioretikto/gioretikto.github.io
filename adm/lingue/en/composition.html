-There are no silent consonants in Latin.

-The letter I in the Latin language was either a vowel or a consonant.</p>

-Here are rules for dividing a word into syllables

-Every syllable in pronunciation is either long or short

-I the word has three or more syllables, the accent falls on the third-last syllable, unless the second-last syllable contains a long vowel or a dipthong or is a closed syllable (a syllable that ends in a consonant). In these cases, the accent falls on the second-last syllable.

-The consonants are divided into two classes - namely, mutes b, c, d, f, k, p, q, t,v; and liquid l,m,n,r. Besides these there are the guttural and the dental aspirates h and s;

-In their search for archaic colouring the poets availed themselves of disused forms of declension and conjugation</p>

-The consants are divided according to the principal organs by which they are pronounced, into Labials(lip-sounds): b,p (ph), f, v,m; Dentals(tooth-sounds)_ d,t, (th), l,n,r,s; Gutturals (throat-sound): g,c,k,qu,(ch);

-If two vowels, which in ordinary circumstances form a diphthong, are to be pronounced separately, the second is marked with (") ; that is, a diaeresis — as poeta, a poet; aer, air; aerius, airy</p>

<li>Many groups of consonants undergo changes in order to facilitate theri pronunciation in rapid speech. These changes involve (a.) Assimilation of consonants; (b) the development of consonantal glides; (c) the loss of one member of the group; (d) the development of a vowel between the consonants.</p>

-The consonants are divided into MUTES and semivowels. The mutes cannot he sounded at all without the aid of a vowel.

-Two nominal forms of the verb are participles and infinitives. Participles combine the verbal characteristics of case, number, and gender and are declined like adjectives.

-A Personal pronoun, as subject, is usually omitted unless emphatic : — loquor, I speak. But, ego loquor, it is I that speak

-Possessive adjectives in Latin are not normally used when they refer to the subject of a clause

An ADJECTIVE (sg. adiectīvum, pl. adiectīva, set next to, added) “adds” information about, ... In these examples, “large” and “ancient” describe “attributes” of the nouns, and adjectives used as simple modifiers in this way are called ATTRIBUTIVE ADJECTIVES. ... MORPHOLOGY refers to the forms of words, such as verb conjugations and nounadjective ...

-An adjective is a word which we add or apply to a noun to denote sone one quality possessed by a person or thing: bonus "good", candidus "white", parvus "small".

-Adjectives can perform two different functions: attributive and appositive: they can be immediate constituents either of a nominal

-When a quality denoted by an adjective is asserted to belong to a noun, the adjective is said to be used predicatively; thus in homines sunt boni, the adjective is a predicative adjective.</p>

-The personal pronouns are expressed in Latin only when they are empathic - as ego feci, non ille, I have done it, not he.

-The personal pronoun is often omitted, as in this example: Te amo (I love you).

-Like personal pronouns, possessive adjectives are used very much less in Latin thanin English. When possible, they are omitted, other than for emphasis, and this includes their being omitted where they never would be omitted in English.

-When two vowels, which under ordinary circumstances form a dipthong, are to be pronounced separetely, the second is marked with diaeresis;

-Thus docēre is stressed on its second syllable, but dūcere is stressed on its first syllable.

-Substantiva mobilia are those substantives which receive different terminations for the masculine and feminine genders.

-The meeting of two vowels, one of which forms the ending and the other the beginning of a word, causes a hiatus or yawning, which is usually avoided in verse by the former of the vowels being thrown out (elisio).

-As the noun varies in gender, number and case, and is substituted by pronouns, and qualified by adjectives, so, the verb varies in mood, tense, person, number and participles, and has the adverb to qualify it.

-All these pronouns except the Personal, Reflexive, and Relative are also used as adjectives: hic vir; this man

-The relative pronoun introducing an adjectival clause must agree with its antecedent in number and gender but it takes its case from the clause it introduces. 1 In Latin we also have adjectival clauses introduced by the relative adjective, which

-In Latin, the relative clause is a little more complicated because of the cases. The relative pronoun must agree with its antecedent in number and gender, but, just as in English, it takes its case from its use in its own clause. Here are the forms 

-A Latin via Ovid Workbook Norma Goldman, Michael Rossi. Chapter ... The relative pronoun refers to this noun in the main clause. ... The relative pronoun must agree with this noun in and , but it takes its case from its use in its own clause.

-A DIPHTHONG is the combined-sound of two vowels meeting in the same syllable;

-But if the Noun in apposition denotes something inanimate, the gender and number of this substantive need not agree ... for, standing with a noun, are often omitted, and the Latin substantive placed in apposition ; as, " NatQra homlni sensus, ...

-A syllable containing a short vowel followed by two consonants (except a mute before l or r) or by a double consonant (x, z) is said to be long by position, but the vowel is pronounced short. est,ter-ra, sax-um, Me-zen-tius

-There are certain cases where the above rules for determining syllable lenght are not strictly applied.

-Dissimilation often involves loss of sounds, as Latin mamor, 'marble,' beside mar- mor 

-Conversely, a consonantal i or u sometimes becomes vocalized before a vowel, thus giving an additional syllable

-Tense denotes the “time” of the verb, that is to say whether the verb describes a present, past, or future action.

-The Direct Object of an action is put in the Accusative : Deus mundum ... Conversely, some verbs intransitive in English are transitive in Latin, or at least are often so used, especially verbs denoting ...

-The Accusative is the case of the Direct Object of a transitive verb. It denotes (a) that which is ... Many verbs which express Feeling, apparently intransitive, take an accusative in Latin and are used in the passive : as, meum casum luctumque doluerunt (Sest. ... and a few others, frequently become transitive, and take the accusative : as, mortem obire, to die. consulatum ineunt (Livy iii.

-The Infinitive mood of all the French verbs ends In er, tr, or re.

-Nego is the opposite of aio; it means 'say no , deny'

-Nego, a first conjugation verb, is the opposite of aio;

-In Latin intervocalic s becomes r, a change known as Rhotacism

-Honores deperat - he despairs of honors

-As both the English verb love and the Latin amō are transitive, in the sentences Cicero loves the girl and Cicerō puellam amat both girl and puellam are direct objects and hence accusative. We might at first suppose that if a verb is transitive in ...

-The well-known phonological process of rhotacism in Latin, whereby intervocalic s (believed to have been pronounced [z]) becomes r, illustrates this point.

-Rhotacism is the process whereby intervocalic [s] changes into [r], as miser, mires.</p>

-During this time the colloquial Latin spoken throughout the Empire, known as Vulgar Latin, was beginning to develop into the different dialects that would later become the Romance Languages

-The evidence of Latin orthography suggests that rhotacism, by which intervocalic etymological *s is changed to r, was operative at least up to the mid-fourth century B.C.E.

-Latin was the language of the people who inhabited ancient Latium. Rome was one of the cities of Latium

-The pronunciation of Church Latin is based on modern Italian pronunciation

-The citizens of ancient Rome spoke the dialect of the region of Latium in central Italy

-In 1528 Erasmus lamented that the divergence of Latin pronunciations across Europe was so wide that this once universal language was no longer mutually intelligible among nations.</p>

-In his De recta ... published in 1528, Erasmus protested against the great diversity of Latin pronunciations across Europe (thus incidentally prodiding us with some of the best evidence for comporary practive). He tried to reestablish Classical pronunciation as the norm and was eventually successful, though in England, France and Germany the reform was not completed unitl the early twentieth century.

-Latin was spoken as well, but not always in a way that contributed to mutual understanding, as is illustrated by an anecdote in Erasmus' De recta latini graecique sermonis pronuntiatione (1528).

-The vast majority of all substantives belonged to the first three declensions.

-You can see from its declension that the form spiritus, which we have in the sentence we are examing, can be genitive singular, 'of the ghost', or nominative or accusative plural, 'ghosts'. Because both noun and adjectives are requires to be of the same number, gender and case, the adjective sancti which is masculine genitive singular, tells us which.

-clause. In this English example Whom is a relative pronoun (and direct object of the verb). In Latin the form will be accusative, masculine, ... The antecedent is the word in the main clause to which the relative pronoun refers (or relates). Here the antecedent is “man,” so in Latin masculine and singular; it is the direct object in its clause and so accusative case. ... Supply the correct form of the relative pronoun to agree with the following antecedents: e.g., consilium (relative in nom. sing.) ...

-[Relative pronouns commonly stand in a different clause from the noun to which they refer, and then agree with it in ... in a different clause, they sometimes agree with the last, but are commonly put in the plural, and in the masculine rather than ...

<h2>Word order</h2>

<ul>

-In other words, in Latin a constituent can change its place without changing its syntactic function

-Since not all word orders (not all permutations of words) are possible, we must admit that Latin word order is governed by rules; but these rules are so liberal and permit so many permutation, that one may have the general impression that word order is as good as free.

-God is good.” * This is a simple sentence, because it contains a subject and a predicate. God is the logical subject, because it is that of which the quality is affirmed. Is good is the logical predicate, because it affirms a quality of its subject.

-An ending can tell you a noun's function and therefore its place in the sentence. Subjects appear in the nominative case, direct objects appear in the accusative case, indirect objects appear in the dative case, and so on.

-Although Latin word order is remarkably free, especially compared to English, there is one strict rule of Latin word order: a preposition wants to come before its noun. The term "preposition" itself alterts you that the preposition wants to come first: it is "pre-positioned" before its noun. This rule is so strong that even a relative pronoun, which likes very much to stand first in its clause, folows the preposition.

-A typical order of words in a simplified Latin sentence or subordinate clause is this: (1) the subject and its modifiers, (2) the indirect object, (3) the direct object, (4) adverbial words or phrases, (5) the verb.

-The word that is used to join this type of clause on to the main clause is the relative pronoun 'who, whom, which, that' (Latin: qui, quae, quod). The Relative Pronoun has to agree with its Antecedent in gender, number and person, but its case

-In latin the order of the words can be relatively unimportant to the sense, thanks to the inflectional endings, which tell so much about the interrelationship of the words in a sentence. On the other end, in English where the inflections are relatively few, the sense commonly dependes on stricter conventions of word oder.

-the ablative of accompaniment is sometimes extended to apply to inanimate objects</p>

-The ablative of accompaniment tells with whom someone does something. It employs the preposition cum.

-The ablative of price is used to express at what cost something was purchased.

-A free use of the preposition a or ab is another striking characteristic of late latin.
 
 
-there is a word order in Latin which is more usual than others, and this is subject–object–verb
 
-Unlike Greek, Latin has no definite or indefinite articles, and this allows a greater freedom in word order and juxtaposition of words. 
 
-it should be noted, in Latin is quite flexible because of the language's inflected nature. In an inflected language, meaning depends on word endings, and word order is flexible.

-The following adjectives are most frequently used as accessory predicates: tristis (in the meaning sadly), laetus

-Thus the Latin sentences, "Petrus videt Paulum" and "Petrus Paulum videt" means the same, as -urn and -us endings of nouns designate the actor and the recipient of action in these two sentences,

-Nouns and Adjectives occur in Latin with a predicative or adverbial sense in various connexions. (1) Nouns referring to official ...

-The passive Periphrastic is a special conjugation that the Romans used to indicate necessity or obligation. Just as the Perfect Passive System is formed by a combination of the Perfect Passive Participle (4th Principal Part of regular verbs) plus various form of sum, esse, the Passive Periphrastic conjugation is a combination of the Gerundive (another name for the Future Passive Participle) plus whatever form of the verb sum, esse is required.

-Finite This term is applied to those forms of verbs which can function as the verbal element of a clause. The only nonfinite forms of a verb in English are participles and infinitives

-With the passive periphrastic, however, the personal agent is normally expressed by the dative case without a preposition.

-Another thing is that Latin uses the weak demonstrative adjective is, ea, id as its third person pronoun.

-Nouns of the first or a-declension have a nominative singular in -a with out case ending and a genitive singular ending in ī (rosa-ī), which in spelling has changed to -e (rosae)

-Originally the genitive singular ended in -s. This ending is still found in archaic expression, such as "pater familias", 'head of the household'.

-Some nouns have a different meaning in the singular and the plural: copia, -ae 'supply', but copiae, -ărum 'troops';

-With the passive periphrastic, classical prose occasionally employs the ablative of agent, chiefly to avoid ambiguity resulting from the presence of two datives.

-Many nouns are used in both the singular and the Plural, but with a difference of meaning.

-The latin term "pluralia tantum" (inherently plural) is sometimes used to denote a range of nouns which can occur only in the plural form.

-Before we leave the fourth declension, we will look at hte noun domus, 'house' which was mentioned earlier. Depending upon the writer, it may have second declension or fourth declension endings.

-subject (or object) of the sentence is often used where in English we should use either an adverb or an adverbialphrase, i.e., a preposition and noun. ... we should add a relative clause, or an infinitive mood, and put the adjective in the predicate of the main sentence. ... Certain nouns also, especially those which relate to time, age, and office, are used in apposition to the subject (or object) of a ... Hocpuer (adulēscēns, senex) didicī. ... He made this vow in his consulship, or as consul.

-Latin does have abstract nouns (as vēritās truth) but these are not used so often as in English. ... our, your, his, her, its, their) and predicative (mine, ours, yours, hers, theirs; his is the same in both uses and its has no predicative form). Latin has ...

-In reference to masculine and feminine subjects, the common adjective predicate or attribute is usually in the masculine gender. ... By an attribute is meant any addition made to a substantive, which serves to individualise the substantive—that is, to describe its ... Special notice must be given to apposition with possessive pronouns, and adjectives which indicate that something belongs to an object.

-As with the fourth declension, there are not many nouns in the fifth declension, but again, among them are some very important ones: res and dies, which can be masculine or feminine.

-The following nouns have a meaning in the plural different from that which generally belongs to them in the singular

-Greek nouns of the first declension often retain their Greek endings in some cases.

-Greek nouns of the first declension end in a, e, as, or es. Those in a and e are feminine; those in as and es are masculine. Gree nouns in a are declined like musa, but have sometimes an in the accusative singular. Greek nouns in as, es, and e, are thus declines in singular:

-Æneas and Anchises are the Greek names of two Trojan heroes; and, like other Greek proper nouns, are variously declined in Latin. In Greek, they belong to the first declension: and it seems that, on their first introduction into Latin, they were changed into Aenea and Anchisa; that is, into regular nouns of the first declension. But proper nouns and common nouns did not meet with exaclty the same fate. The commond nouns, being frequently used, retained their new Latin forms, and passed current as regular Latin nouns. But the proper nouns, being seldom used, sounded strange in their new Latin forms, and partially slid back into their old Greek forms. Thus we find Greek proper nouns declinde in Latin both with Greek and Latin terminations; some writers inclining to the former, some to the latter.</p>

-In the plural, Greek nouns of the first declension are declined like the plural of musa.

-In Latin, however, the word et can also function as an adverb, meaning something like “also,” “too” or “even.

-Latin writers often change Greek nouns in ē, and sometimes those in ēs, into a; as; grammatica for grammatice; Atrida, for Atrides.

-Some Greek nouns (chiefly proper names) end in as, ēs (m.), and e (p.) in the nominative, and an or en in the accusative; those in ē have the genitive in ēs (stem a or ē): as</p>

-Words in ius (ium) have the genitive singular for the most part in ī until the first century a.d.; without change of accent: ingeʹnī (nom., ingenium), of genius; Vergiʹlī, of Vergil.

-The vocative of proper names in ius ends in i instead of ie, e.g., Antóni, Mercuri, Terenti, Tulli, Virgili.

-The locative singular ends in ī like the genitive, as Rhodīī, at Rhodes; Tarentī, at Tarentum.

-The accusative singular ending im is found always is sitis, thirst, tussis, cough, vīs, strenght; and in names of town and rivers in is, as Neapolis, Naples; Tibersi, Tiber; usually in febris, fever; puppis.

-The 3rd declension is divided into two major groups called imparisyllabics and parisyllabics

-The Direct Object of an action is put in the Accusative : Deus mundum aedlficavit, God made the world. ... Many verbs, generally intransitive, sometimes become so far transitive as to admit an accusative of cognate or kindred meaning : Earn ...

-Libera rem publicam - Free the republic

-Populi Romani salutem defendite - Defend the safety of the Roman people

-Mirum sonniare somnium  (Plaut.) - to dream a wonderful dream

-with simple tenses of dicor, trador, feror, etc., we usually have the persomal constructiom, with compound tenses, the impersonal comstructiom ; but we generally have the personal construction with all tenses of iubeor, vetor, and video

-Transitive and Intransitive Verbs 273, Verbs are either Transitive or Intransitive. 1. A Transitive Verb has or requires a direct object to complete its sense (see § 274): as, – fråtrem cecidit, he slew his ... in meaning, requires the direct object (Objective):— hominem videó, I see the man (Accusative). homini serviö, I serve the ...

-The Accusative is the case of the Direct Object of a transitive verb. It denotes (a) that which is directly affected, or (b) that which is caused or produced by the action of the verb : as, Brutus Caesarem interfecit, Brutus killed ...

-Proceedings of the 1st International Colloquium on Latin Linguistics, Amsterdam, April 1981 Harm Pinkster ... sentence can hold the Accusative either as a direct object or as a direct object accompanied by a predicative complement (such is the case verified with the Verba Sentiendi and Dicendi + an infinitive sentence whose predicate is a nominal one, e.g. puto/credo/dico te bonum esse)

-a nominative– accusative system for pronouns and an ergative–absolutive one (in certain respects) for ordinary NPs (see La Fauci 1988; 1997). Compare also the ... The direct object remains essentially a non-prepositional argument, as in Latin. An important ... In Latin, the participle was a predicative complement of the direct object, and therefore agreed with its semantic subject

-Imparisyllabics use two paradigms, dolor for masculines and feminines, caput for neuters.

-Some nouns in the 3rd declension have a change in stem.

-To form the present passive tense of a Latin verb, the personal endings of the passive voice (see below) are added to the stem of the verb in all persons except the first ... Passive Endings Singular Plural First person -r I -mur we Second person ...

-Verbs have terminations for each of the three persons, both singular and plural, active and passive. ... All Latin words ending in t, except a few in ot, ut, with et, at, sat, are third persons of verbs ; all in nt are third persons pluraL In dumtaxat, ...

-Most Greek nouns of the third declension are entirely regular, but a few retain certain peculiarities of the Greek, and some are entirely indeclinable.

-A principal proposition makes complete sense when standing alone; a dependent proposition does not make complete sense alone, but must be ... A proposition introduced by a relative pronoun is called a dependent relative proposition

-Nouns of the third declension may be divided into two great classes, the parisyllabic and the imparisyllabic, that is, 1. those having an equal number of syllables in all the cases; and, 2. those that have an unequal number of syllables in all the cases; these latter take an additional syllable in the genitive singular, which they retain to the end, and therefore are said to increase in the genitive case. Of the parisyllabic these words are instances; piscis, nom, piscis, gen, a fish; mare, maris, the sea. Of the imparisyllabic take as specimen, arbor, arboris, "a tree"

-When a relative pronoun refers to more than one substantive, it is usually put in the plural. ... Sometimes, however, the relative agrees in number and gender only with the last of several substantives — that is, with the one nearest to it — as ... Sometimes several names of inanimate things may be of the same gender, and the relative, instead of taking their gender in the plural, appears in the neuter plural ...


-Note that videor, the passive of video (Unit 9), means 'seem' when used with an infinitive. ... the indefinite pronoun (quidam, quaedam, quiddam) are identical in declension save for the spelling of the neuter singular nominative/ accusative.

-Turpe mihi ipsi videbatur in eam urbem me audere reverti, ex qua Brutus cederet (Cic.) - Even thought it a shame that I should venture to retuvn to a city from which Brutus was retiring.
-The peculiarities of formation found in nouns of the third declension suggest some attention to the doctrice of the stem. The stem of a noun is that part which remains when the ending of the genitive case is take away; thus from domini take i, you have domin, the stem; from doloris take is, you have dolor, the stem; maris, remove the s, (the i belongs to the root), you have mari, the stem. Sometimes there is a slight change in the consonants, ad dux, ducis, duc; rex, regis, reg. Stems which end in a consonants are termed consonantal; those which end in a vowel, are called vocal.

-Nouns of the 3rd Declension are divided into Parisyllabics and Imparisyllabies. Parisyllabics have the same number of syllables in the genitive as in the nominative. Imparisyllabies have more syllables in the genitive than in the nominative.

-The main difference between imparisyllabics and parisyllabics is gen. pl. ending, which is "-um" in former and "-ium" in the latter group. Unfortunately, Latin words are usually provided in the vocabulary form, which consists of Nom. Sg., Gen Sg. ending, and gender. The gen. Pl is not included. As a result the vocabulary form cannot be directly used for purpose of identification of parisyllabics.

-In the following sentences (all from Vergil) we have caelō used in three different ways: 1 It caelō clāmorque virum ... Latin. reading. In addition to translating, define the use of each dative and ablative (except ablatives after prepositions). 1 In id ..

-One of the more elegant features of Latin is the enclitic -que, which attaches to the end of a word and means the same thing as if ... In addition to being used as an alternative to et, the suffix -que can also be used to create compound words.

<ul>
-The verb edo (I eat) may be conjugated regularly after the third conjugation, perf, edi, sup, esum, inf edere; but in several of its forsm a syncope is sometimes employed, in consequence of which they become like the corresponding tenses of the verb sum.

-The predicate is the basis of a kernel and of the sentence. All other kernel and sentence consituents are related semantically and syntactically to this basis.

-<i>aio</i> has a very full use in colloquial Latin. Is is employed as the plain opposite of <i>nego</i>; as in <i>vel ai vel nega</i> (Naevius), "says yes or no". In indirect discourse <i>aio</i> is preferred to inquam;

<p>But in compounds, this sense is more frequently expressed by the prefix of Latin source, bi or bis, or the correspondent Greek forms, di or dis.

-When a relative refers to a whole clause, and not to a particular word, the neuter singular is used, before which the pronoun id is frequently added, the clause being treated as a neuter substantive - as Sapientes contenti sunt rebus suis, quod est summum bonum; si a vobis deserar, id quod non spero

-In the passive, the syncope takes place only in editur, estur, and ederetur, essetur

-The Relative Pronoun is used like a conjunction to connect two clauses in a sentence: the second of the two connected clauses may be either subordinate to, or co-ordinate with the first. The relative pronoun always refers back to some noun or pronoun (expressed or implied) in the clause which it connects to the clause in which it stands. This noun or pronoun is called its Antecedent. In Latin, relative pronouns agree with their antecedent in gender, number and person, but not in case. The case of a relative pronoun dependes on the function which it performs in the clause in which it stands. The relative pronoun can never be omitted in Latin as it often is in English.

-In Latin, the tenses of the infinitive express its action as past, present, or future, not with regard to the present time, as in the otehr moods, but with regard to the time of the leading verb, on which it is dependent i.e.: The present infinitive represents the action or state expressed by the verb, and consequenlty must be rendered into English in the time of the leading verb; as dixit se scribere, "he said that he was writing"; dicit se scribere, "he says that he is writing"; The perfect infinitive represents the action or state expressed by the verb, as past at the time of the leading verb, and must be rendered accordingly, i.e., after a past tense, by the English Pluperfect; and after the present , by the English imperfect or perfect; as, dixit se scripisse, "he said that he had writte", dicit se scripisse, "he says that the has written". The future infinitive represent the action or state expressed by the verb, as future at the time of the leading verb, and must be rendered accordingly; dixit se scripturum esse, "he said that the would write"; dicit se scripturum esse, "he says that he will write".

-Possessive adjectives are of two type in English, attributive (my, our, your, his, her, its, thei) and predicative (mine, ours, hers, etc). latin has similar possessive adjectives for the first and second persons only, but these can be used either or predicatevely.

-An Attributive element is used adjectively when employed as a modifier of any Substantive term

-Both Latin and English employ transitive and intransitive verbs. Whereas transitive verbs take a direct object, intransitive verbs do not. In some cases, a verb can be either transitive or intransitive depending on whether a speaker or writer supplies a direct object.

-The ablative of means tells the thing (always an inanimate object, never a person or animal) with which something is done. 

-The infinitive stands as an object (accusative) after many verbs which express an incomplete idea, and require another verb to complete it. Verbs of this kind are those denoting will, power, custom inclination, beginning, coninuing, neglecting and others- as volo, nolo, malo, cupio, studeo, conor, nitor., contendo, tento (in poetry also quaero and amo), possum, queo, nequeo (in poetry valeo), audeo (sustineo), vereo (metuo, timeo), scuo, nescio, disco, debeo, soleo, adsuesco, consuesco, statuo, constituo, decerno, cogito, paro.</p>
