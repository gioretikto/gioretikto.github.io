<h1>Conditionals</h1>

<p>Conditional tenses are used to speculate about what could happen, what might have happened, and what we wish would happen. In English, most sentences using the conditional contain the word <em>if</em>. Many conditional forms in English are used in sentences that include verbs in one of the past tenses. This usage is referred to as "the unreal past" because we use a past tense but we are not actually referring to something that happened in the past. There are five main ways of constructing conditional sentences in English. In all cases, these sentences are made up of an <em>if</em> clause and a main clause. In many negative conditional sentences, there is an equivalent sentence construction using "unless" instead of "if".</p>

<h3>The zero conditional</h3>

<p>The zero conditional is used for when the time being referred to is <strong>now or always</strong> and the situation is <strong>real and possible</strong>. The zero conditional is often used to refer to general truths. The tense in both parts of the sentence is the simple present. In zero conditional sentences, the word "if" can usually be replaced by the word "when" without changing the meaning.</p>

<h3>Type 1 conditional</h3>

<p>The type 1 conditional is used to refer to the <strong>present or future</strong> where the <strong>situation is real</strong>. The type 1 conditional refers to a possible condition and its probable result. In these sentences the if clause is in the simple present, and the main clause is in the simple future.</p>

<tr> <td><strong>If + simple present</strong></td> <td><strong>simple future</strong></td></tr>
<tr> <td>If this thing happens</td> <td>that thing will happen.</td></tr> <tr>
<td>If you don't hurry</td> <td>you will miss the train.</td></tr>
<tr> <td>If it rains today</td> <td>you will get wet.</td></tr>

<h3>Type 2 conditional - Hypothetical conditional clauses</h3>

<p>In the second type of conditioanl clause, the past tense is used to indicate <b>modal remoteness</b>; the event or state coded in the condition is seen as less likely to be fulfilled, through not hypothetically impossibile. The structure if <b><i>if</b></i> + <b>past tense remote</b> + <b>would</b> or another 'remove modal such as <i>could</i> or <i>might</i> preceding the lexical verb in the main clause.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>if you left now, you would (might) catch the last train;</p></li>
	<li><p>if Tom passed his driving test, he would soon be buying a car.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If the verb in the conditional clause is <i><b>be</b></i>, the subjunctive mood form <i><b>were</b></i> is preferred, in good usage, to the indicative <i><b>was</b></i>, not only with plural subjects but also singular. <br>The expression <i>If I were you</i> is conventionally used to give advide:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>If I <b>were</b> you, I wouldn't agree to carry a package for someone on a flight.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Type 3 conditional</h3>

<p>The type 3 conditional is used to refer to a time that is <strong>in the past</strong>, and a situation that is <strong>contrary to reality</strong>. The facts they are based on are the opposite of what is expressed. The type 3 conditional is used to refer to an unreal past condition and its probable past result. In type 3 conditional sentences, the if clause uses the past perfect, and the main clause uses the perfect conditional.</p>

<thead>
<tr> <th>If clause</th> <th>Main clause</th> </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr> <td><strong>If + past perfect</strong></td> <td><strong>perfect conditional or perfect continuous conditional</strong></td> </tr>
<tr> <td>If this thing had happened</td> <td>that thing would have happened. (but neither of those things really happened) OR<br> that thing would have been happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>If you had studied harder</td> <td>you would have passed the exam.</td></tr>
<tr> <td>If it had rained</td> <td>you would have gotten wet.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>If I had accepted that promotion</td> <td>I would have been working in Milan.</td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Mixed type conditional</h3>

<p>The mixed type conditional is used to refer to a time that is <strong>in the past</strong>, and a situation that is <strong>ongoing into the present</strong>. The facts they are based on are the opposite of what is expressed. The mixed type conditional is used to refer to an unreal past condition and its probable result in the present. In mixed type conditional sentences, the if clause uses the past perfect, and the main clause uses the present conditional.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr> <th>If clause</th> <th>Main clause</th> </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr> <td><strong>If + past perfect or simple past</strong></td> <td><strong>present conditional or perfect conditional</strong></td></tr>
<tr> <td>If this thing had happened</td> <td>that thing would happen. (but this thing didn't happen so that thing isn't happening)</td></tr>
<tr> <td>If I had worked harder at school</td> <td>I would have a better job now.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>If we had looked at the map</td> <td>we wouldn't be lost.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>If you weren't afraid of spiders</td> <td>you would have picked it up and put it outside.</td></tr>

<h2>Rhetorical conditional clauses</h2>

<ul>
	<li><p>It's a stupid idea, <i>if you aske me</i>;</p></li>
	<li><p>Let me introduce myself, <i>if I may</i> (In which the speaker pretends to ask permission of the hearer to introduce herself).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Expressions such as <i>If Jack Jones is the best golfer in Italy, I'm Tiger Woords</i>, are also instances of rhetorical condition.</p>
