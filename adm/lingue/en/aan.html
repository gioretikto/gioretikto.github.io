<h1>Articles</h1>

<p>In English there is no <b>grammatical gender</b>. That is to say, unless a noun refers to a person (who is by nature a male or female) or other animal, especially household pets, that noun is said to be neuter, without gender. Note, however, that certain impersonal nouns are given a gender, usually feminine. This applies especially to transportaton vessels:</p>

<p>The ship was launched to the delight of the jubilant crowd, and off she sailed towards the horizon.</p>

<p>While the neuter pronoun "it" would not be incorrect, the use of "she" in the first sentence is a convention in English (ships and boats are always feminine).</p>

<h2>A and An</h2>

<p>Because of this lack of gender, English has only one form for the definite and indefinite articles. "The" is the definite article, and "a" is the indefinite article, although remember that the latter must be changed to "an" before a vowel sound. Note that this rule does not apply simply before a vowel, but before a vowel sound:</p>

<p>For example, an accident, an item, an hour. We use a otherwise: a book, a hotel, a habit, a university, a unicorn, a hyperbola.</p>

<p>Because the first vowel of "unicorn" is pronounced "yu", the regular indefinite article is used.</p>

<p>Following this rule, we would say a historic, not an historic because (for most speakers) historic doesn't start with a vowel sound.</p>

<h2>When not to use the article</h2>

<p>Unquantifiable nouns such as "happiness", "sadness", "beauty", and "freedom" should be used without an article unless a particular case is being referred to.</p>

<p><b>Worng:</b> The freedom is something to which all prisoners aspire. <br>
<b>Right:</b> Freedom is something to which all prisoners aspire.</p>
