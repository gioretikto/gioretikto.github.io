<p>The Saxon Genitive is used with the nouns for people, animals, countries, expressions of time, as well as the collective names for people and animals. It establishes a <b>relationship of ownership</b> or <b>possession</b> between two terms.</p>

<p>The Saxon genitive is formed by adding an apostrophe and an “s” to the name of the owner.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Robin’s car is green.</p></li>

	<li><p>Julia’s dog is a beautiful westie.</p></li>

	<li><p>My mum’s coat is brown.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If the name of the owner is plural, only the apostrophe is added. The same happens in the case of words that end with “s“.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>The sailors’ boat.</p></li>
	<li><p>My friends’ new home.</p></li>
	<li><p>Texas’ weather is unpredictable in the winter.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of proper names both constructions can be used.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Mr. Jones’ cat is very old.</p></li>
	<li><p>Mr. Jones’s cat is very old.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In compound names, the apostrophe and the “s” are added at the end of the last word.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>My brother-in-law’s cousin.</p></li>

	<li><p>My mother-in-law’s house is on the hill.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When there are several owners, the Saxon genitive rule is applied to the last name of the set.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Mario and Susan’s children attend primary school.</p></li>
	<li><p>This is John and Jean’s car.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>With collective names, the Saxon genitive is formed with an apostrophe and “s“.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>People’s rights.</p></li>
	<li><p>Women’s hair.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Go to the Doctor's or to the doctor</h2>

<p>Both phrases are common.</p>

<p>I must go to the dentist's</p>
<p>I must go to the dentist</p>
<p>I must go and see the doctor/dentist.</p>

<p>The genitive form is more common in the following expressions</p>

<p>I must go to the barber's / to the barber</p>
<p>They had a regular appointment at the haidresser.</p>
