<h1>Countable and uncountable nouns</h1> 

<p>Nouns can be either countable or uncountable. <b>Countable nouns</b> (or count nouns) are those that refer to something that can be counted. They <b>have both singular and plural forms</b> (e.g. cat/cats; woman/women; country/countries). In the singular, they can be preceded by a or an. Most nouns come into this category.</p>

<p>A smaller number of nouns do not typically refer to things that can be counted and so they <b>do not regularly have a plural form</b>: these are known as <b>uncountable nouns</b> (or mass nouns). Examples include: rain, flour, earth, wine, or wood. Uncountable nouns can't be preceded by a or an. Many abstract nouns are typically uncountable, e.g. happiness, truth, darkness, humour.</p>

<p>When we talk about large numbers and amount in a vague way, we can use <b>many</b> before plural nouns, <b>much</b> before uncountable nouns, and <b>a lot of</b> before both types of nouns. The word "people" is plural so it is countable:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Many people believe in life after death.</p></li>
	<li><p>Are many people coming to your party?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For example "water" is uncountable, because you cannot say "five waters".</p>

<p>Some uncountable nouns can be used in the plural as well, depending on the meaning or context of the word. Take a look at these sentences:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>Would you like some coffee? (uncountable because it's referring to the drink in general)</p></li>
    <li><p>He ordered a coffee. (countable, because it's referring to a cup of coffee)</p></li>
    <li><p>There's no truth in the rumours. (uncountable, because it refers to the quality or state of being true)</p></li>
    <li><p>The fundamental truths about human nature. (countable, because it's referring to facts or beliefs that are true)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are some words that should only be used with countable nouns and some that you should only use with uncountable nouns. Here are the main examples:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>word</td> <th>with countable noun?</th>  <th>with uncountable noun?</td> <th>examples</th></tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr><td>few, fewer</td> <td>✓</td> <td>✗</td> <td>fewer students; few cars</td></tr>
<tr><td>little, less, least </td><td>✗</td> <td>✓</td> <td>less food; little time</td></tr>
<tr><td>many, several</td> <td>✓</td> <td>✗</td> <td>several books; many changes</td></tr>
<tr><td>much</td> <td>✗ <td>✓ <td>much pleasure; much sleep</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>You often hear people using less with countable nouns (e.g. ‘there are less cars outside the school gates’). Although it's a common mistake, it is still a mistake and you should try to avoid making it in formal writing or speaking.</p>
