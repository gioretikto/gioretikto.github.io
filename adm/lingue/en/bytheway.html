<h1>By the way: First use</h1> 

<p>By the way is used to introduce a new subject to be considered or to give further information: </p>

<ul>
    <li><p>I think we've discussed everything we need to - by the way, what time is it?</p></li>
    <li><p>Oh, by the way, my name's Julie.</p></li>
    <li><p>The name Latifah, by the way, means 'delicate'.</p></li>
    <li><p>By the way, how did your seminar go?</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>By the way: Second use</h1> 

<p>It is used also for introducing a statement or subject that may not be directly related to the subject being discussed. It can be used when you want to change the topic of conversation. </p>

<ul>
    <li><p>By the way, I heard that Phyllis may be moving to Dallas.</p></li>
    <li><p>"oh, by the way Katie, you had a call"</p></li>
</ul>    

<h2>It's time</h2>

<p>We can use the expression <b>it’s time + subject + past verb</b> form to refer to the present moment:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Gosh! It’s almost midnight. It’s time we <b>went</b> home.<br> 
    <del>Not: It’s time we go home.</del></p></li>
    <li><p>"We've allowed our competitors to get the upper hand for too long; it's time we <b>started</b> hitting back with a really good advertising campaign
</ul>

<p>It’s time with a verb in the to-infinitive form can refer to the speaker and the listener together:</p>

   <ul>
   	<li><p>Come on. It’s time to start packing. We have to leave in two hours. (or It’s time we <b>started</b> packing.)</p></li>
   </ul>
