<h1>Degree determiners: Much, many, little, few, a lot of, lots, plenty</h1> 

<h2>Forme affermative: a lot of</h2>

<p>We use <b>a lot of/lots of/plenty of</b> with both <i>uncountable</i> and <i>plural</i> nouns:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>a lot of luck, a lot of friends, They've got a lot of things to do</p></li>
	<li><p>lots of time, lots of people</p></li>
	<li><p>plenty of money, plenty of ideas.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When we want to indicate "a large quantity of" or "a large number of", we use different words, depending on wheter we want to ask something, make a negative statement or make an affermative statement.</p>

<p><u>In affermative</u> we only use <b>a lot of</b> or <b>lots of</b> with both uncountable and countable nouns. In <u>questions</u> we use <b>much</b> (with uncountables) and <b>many</b> (with countable), or <b>a lot of</b> with both countable and uncountable nouns.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Is there much money in your bank?</p></li>
	<li><p>Are there many boys playing football?</p></li>
	<li><p>Did you see a lot of children on the beach?</p></li>
	<li><p>Have they got many things to do?</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Much</b> is unusual in positive sentence (especially in splen English)</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>We spent <b>a lot of</b> money (not spend much money)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Forme negative: a lot of; much; many</h2>

<p>In <u>negatives</u> we use <b>not ... much</b> (with uncountables) and <b>not ... many</b> (with countables), or <b>not ... a lot of</b> with both countable and uncountable nouns.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>There isn't much money in my bank</p></li>
	<li><p>They haven't got many things to do</p></li>
</ul>

<p>“Many people,” is correct. “Much people,” is always incorrect.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Many people drive too fast or <b>A lor of</b> people drive too fast.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>“Many” should refer to multiple individuals; “much” means a large amount of some kind of stuff, commodity or substance.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>You can have many dollars, but you have much money.</p></li>
	<li><p>The beach has many pebbles, but has much gravel.</p></li>
	<li><p>There are many people living in this small place, so there is much crowding.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can say, “There were a lot of people,” or, “There was a huge crowd (of people),” or, “There were many people there,” etc.</p>

<h2>More and Most</h2>

<p>We use <b>more</b> and <b>most</b> instead of <i>much/many</i> in comparsions. We use <i>more</i> for "a larger number or amount" and <i>most</i> for "the largest number or amount".</p>

<p>So if you have 4 types of affected... 10%, 30%, 50%, 90%, 30, 50 and 90 are more affected than 10, but only 90 is most affective.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><b>More</b> children are being educated at home. They are spending <b>more</b> time with their parents</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Most</b> American teenagers say they have <b>most</b> fun when they are shopping "at the mall".</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We can use <i>more of</i> and <i>most of</i> before determiners, pronouns and proper nouns.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>I've already eaten <b>more of</b> the cake than I should</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Most of</b> those bananas were rotten.</p></li>
	<li><p>I really liked it, but I can't eat any <b>more of</b> it</p></li>
	<li><p>I had to thtrow <b>most of</b> them away.</p></li>
	<li><p>I hope to see <b>more of</b> Spain during my next trip.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Most of</b> Venice is under water</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We can use other quantifiers before <i>more (not <i>most</i>) with the meaning 'additional'.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>I don't need <b>much more</b> time, just <b>two more</b> hours.</p></li>
	<li><p>Is there <b>any more</b> tea? There's <b>no more</b></p></li>
</ul>
