<h2>Verbs followed by gerund or infinitive</h2>

<p>With some verbs, especially those that explain, report or warn, after the main verb, you can sometimes use <b>that</b>, sometimes a <b>gerund</b> (verb-ing form), other times an <b>infinitive</b> (with to), and other times, either a gerund or an infinitive. Sentences that make promises, warnings, offers, suggestions or recommendations use these verb structures.</p>

<h3>Verbs with infinitives</h3>

<p>afford, decide, hope, promise, arrange, demand, manage, refuse, claim, expect, offer, undertake, choose, fail, plan, would like.</p>

<ul>

	<li><p>Toby told me that he was going to France on holiday. (tell + that + independent clause)</p></li>
	<li><p>I <b>promised</b> my father <b>to do</b> my best always.<br>

<p>advise, forbid, mean, start, allow, forget, need, stop, begin, go on, permit, try bother, hate, prefer, can't bear, intend, propose, continue, like, regret, encourage, love, remember.</p>

<p>After these verbs, a to-infinitive refers to the <b>future</b>, while a gerund expresses an <b>earlier action</b>, relative to the time of the verb in the main clause:</p>
