<h1>Past Perfect for a sequence of past events</h1>

<p>Utilizziamo il Simple Past quando raccontiamo (in ordine) una serie di eventi che si sono svolti nel passato. Se da questo punto nel passato, dal quale stiamo raccontando, rivolgiamo lo sguardo verso azioni che si sono svolte ancora prima, impieghiamo il <b>Past Perfect</b>. Si usa per un evento passato che è successo prima di un altro evento passato (Past Perfect usually has the meaning of <b>past in the past</b>). Es.:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>The meeting had already started when they arrived;</p></li>
	<li><p>The police arrested the man who had stolen Julien's car</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The Past perfect refers to what had happened <b>before</b> events described by either the Simple Past or the Past Continuous.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>They <b>chose</b> this school because they <b>had heard</b> that it promoted discipline.</p></li>
	<li><p>When <b>she arrived</b>, we <b>had</b> already <b>eaten</b>.</p></li>
	<li><p>I greatly <b>enjoyed</b> my last holiday: I <b>had</b> never <b>been</b> to Italy before.</p></li>
	<li><p>When he <b>met</b> her, she <b>had been</b> a teacher for five years.</p></li>
	<li><p>By the time we <b>were supposed</b> to leave, he <b>had had</b> too much to drink.</p></li>
	<li><p>We <b>had hoped</b> to throw a big party, but I <b>was</b> too busy writing my book.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Interchangeable Past Perfect and Simple Past</h2>

<p>Sometimes, it is possible to use <i>either</i> the Simple Past or the Past Perfect. This usually happens when we use <b><i>before, after, by the time</i></b>, etc., because such prepositions or adverbials make the sequence of events crystal clear. The following three pairs of sentences have identical meanings.</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Simple Past</th> <th>Past Perfect</th></tr>
<tr><td>After he <b>retired</b>, he took up golf. </td> <td>After he <b>had retired</b>, he took up golf.</td> </tr>
<tr><td>She gave away many of her possessions before she emigrated.</td> <td>She <b>had given</b> away many of her possessions before she emigrated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>By the time the police arrived, he <b>disappeared</b>.</td> <td>By the time the police arrived, he <b>had disappeared</b>. </td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Past Perfect in reported (indirect) speech</h2>

<p>Quite often, the Past Perfect is used in <b>reported speech</b> (also referred to as <b>indirect speech</b>), i.e. when we are recounting what somebody said or wrote about something that had happened before the time of speaking/ writing. In such cases, the Past Perfect helps to establish the sequence of events — particularly if there are no time adverbials present.</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Simple Past</th> <th>Past Perfect</th></tr>
<tr><td>She admits she <b>was</b> wrong. She admitted she <b>had been</b> wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>They say it <b>was</b> not easy. They said it <b>had</b> not <b>been</b> easy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The report has claimed that he <b>abused</b> them.</td> <td>The report claimed that he <b>had abused </b>them. </td></tr>
</table>

<p>It is often necessary to use the PAst perfect for clarifying the sequence of past events, particularly with reported (indirect) speech. Sometimes, using the simple past instead of past perfect changes the intended meaning; this is illustrated below.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><b>Simple past in reported speech: He admitted that he <b>lied</b> (This would make him a habitual liar, but he was unlikely to have meant that)</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Past Perfect in reported speech: He admitted that he <b>had lied</b> (he might have lied on a <i>particular</i> occasion, but this does not make him a habitual liar).</p></li>
</ul>
