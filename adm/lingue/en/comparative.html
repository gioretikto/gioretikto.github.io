<h1>Comparative</h1>

<p>The degrees of comparison are known as the positive (the adjective itself), the comparative, and the superlative.</p>

<p>In comparative degree, comparison is made between two things only. And we require at least three things to correctly use the superlative degree of comparison. Notice also that the word than frequently
accompanies the comparative (taller than) and the word the precedes the superlative (the tallest).</p>

<p>When you form the comparative and the superlative remember this:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><p>Adjective + er/ier or est (quicker/quickest) is used if the adjective has one syllable only.</p></li>
		<li><p>More/Most + adjective, as well as Adjective + er/ier or est (stupider/stupidest as well as more stupid/most stupid), is used for adjectives with two syllables.</p></li>
		<li><p>More/Most + adjective, is used for adjectives (more/most beautiful) with more than two syllables.</p></li>
	</ul>
	
<p>If you are in doubt about the number of syllables in a word, look it up in a dictionary and notice how it is broken down; you can easily see the number of syllables. Example, com-pli-men-ta-ry means the word complimentary has five syllables.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>He is stupider than I thought. (also more stupid)</p></li>
	<li><p>He is the handsomest man on earth. (also the most handsome)</p></li>
	<li><p>This habit is commoner in India than in Pakistan. (also more common)</p></li>
</ul>
