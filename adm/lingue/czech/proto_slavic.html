<h1>Proto-Slavic and the Slavic languages</h1>

<p>Certain languages are more closely related and others distantly related to one another. For a Pole, the most closely related languages are those which, like Czech or Russian, he can partially understand, even without studying them. Laguages like Hungarian or Turkish are completely different from Polish and, therefore afford significanltly greater difficulty to a Pole in learning them. In fact historical investigations have proven that the differences between such closely related languages as Polish and Czech were one much smaller than they are today. When we compare the Polish and Czech were once much smaller than they are today. When we compare the Polish nouns and proper names written in Polish oldest existing text, <i>Bulla gniezieska</i> (The Gniezno Bull) 1136, with contemporary Czech words, the differences appear insignificant. The further back we go in tie, the greater the similarity between Polish and Czech. This phenomenon may be traced, on the basis of existing texts, all the way back to the 12th and 11th centuries A.D. Because of the lack of older texts, we cannot carry intestigation further into the past. The fact that − the further we go into the past, the greater the similarity between such closely related languages as Polish and Czech − leads to the assumption that these languages arose as a result of different courses of evolution occurring in different regionions form a proto-language common to both of these languages.</p>

<p>The same factors as those obtaining in the relation between Polish and Czech force us to postulate the existence of a proto-language common to all Slavic languages − i.e, Polish Lower Lusatian, Upper Lusatian, Czech, Slovak, Slovene, Serbo-Croatian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Ukranian, Russian, and White Russian. The common proto-language common to all of these languages and from which they all developed is called <b>proto-Slavic</b>. <br> Proto-Slavic will always be a postulation, an extremely probable scientific hypothesis,, for no text written in this language have been found. Th oldest preserved Slavic texts. i.e., copies of the translation of the Holy Scripture, the work of Constantin-Cyril and Methodius, c. 863, althoug linguistically very close to Proto-Slavic, have already taken on a definite Macedonian-Bulgarian tone and cannot be considered a survival of proto-Slavic.</p>

<p>The proto-Slavic language first split into three lanaguages groups − the proto-Russic or East-Slavic group, the South-Slavic group and the West-Slavic group. Only later did three Russic languages branch off from the proto-Russic to form White Russian, Russian and Ukranian; The South-Slavic group split up into Bulgarian-Macedonian, Serbo-Croatian and Slovene; the West-Slavic group became differentiated into the Czecho-Slovakian branch of languages, the Lusatian languages (including two distinct languages − Lower-Lusatian and Upper-Lusatian) as well as Polish(including the Kashubian dialects). It follows, that the Slavic languages are not all related to one another to the same degree. Ukranian, e.g. is more closely related to Russian than to Polish because together with Russian it derived from the proto-Russic group, which constitued a relative unity up to the 12th century A.D., while the ancestors of Polish and Ukranian lost linguistic contact with each other and constitued part of separate language groups somwhere around the 6th century A.D.</p>

<p>A group of neighboring languages which owing, to mutual influences, beoe more similar to one another in phonological, morphological or syntactic structure, is called a <b>league of languages</b>. Languages belonging to the same league are affiliated languages. Linguists have claimed, for example, the existence of a Balkan league of languages composed of Modern greek, Albanian, Bulgarian and Rumanian. The first and second of these languages constitute distinc language categories, Bulgarian belongs to the Slavic family and Rumanian to the Romance family − al four of these languages, therefore, were very different from one another in structure between the 6th and 10th centuries A.D., when they came into geographical contact. In the course, however, of the last several centuries, owing to the mutual influences of their syntactic and inflectional systems, a series of innovations occured making these languages more similar to one another.</p>
