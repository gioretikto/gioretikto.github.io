<h1>Cases</h1>

<p>Case/Падеж refers to the form of a noun, pronoun, or adjective-noun combination and shows its grammatical relationship to the other words in the sentence.</p>

<h2>The nominative case (имени́тельный паде́ж)</h2>

<p>Nouns, pronouns, and adjectives always appear in the nominative case in an English-Russian dictionary. The main function of the nominative case is to indicate the subject of the sentence. All the Russian words we use in the earlier section “Beginning with Nouns and Pronouns” are in the nominative case. The nominative case requires no changes in ending. As a rule, the subject behaves the same way in Russian as it does in English. It answers the question “Who or what is performing the action?” For example, in the sentence Девочка изучает русский язык (dyeh-vahch-kuh ee-zooh-chah-eet roohs-keey ee-zik) (A girl studies Russian), the word девочка, indicating a girl who studies Russian, is the subject of the sentence and consequently is used in the nominative case.</p>

<h2>The genitive case</h2>

<p>One of the important functions of the genitive case is to indicate possession. It answers the question “Whose?” In the phrase книга девочки (knee-guh dyeh-vahch-kee) (the girl’s book), the word девочка takes the genitive case (девочки) because she’s the book’s owner. The genitive case also is used to indicate an absence of somebody or something when you combine it with the word нет (nyeht) (no/not), as in Здесь нет книги (zdees’ neet knee-gee) (There’s no book here). Книги (knee-gee) (book) is in the genitive case because the book’s absence is at issue. In addition, Russian uses the genitive case after many common prepositions, including the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>без (byehs) (without)</p></li>
	<li><p>вместо (vmyehs-tah) (instead of)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>The accusative case</h2>

<p>The accusative case is very often used to indicate a direct object, which is the object of the action of the verb in a sentence. For example, in the sentence Я люблю литературу (ya lyooh-blyooh lee-tee-ruh-tooh-rooh) (I love literature), the word literature is in the accusative case because it’s the direct object of the verb. That’s why the form of the word is no longer литература (lee-tee-ruh-tooh-ruh; the nominative case) but rather литературу (lee-tee-ruh-tooh-rooh). Verbs like читать (chee-taht’) (to read), видеть (vee-deet’) (to see), слушать (slooh-shuht’) (to hear), and изучать (ee-zooh-chaht’) (to study) take the accu- sative case. As in English, these verbs in Russian are transitive verbs (verbs that require a direct object). The accusative case is also required in sentences containing verbs of motion, which indicate destination of movement. For instance, if you want to announce to your family that you’re going to Россия (rah-see-yeh) (Russia), Россия takes the form of the accusative case, which is Россию (rah-see-yooh). You also use the accusative case after certain prepositions, such as про (proh) (about) and через (chyeh-rees) (through).</p>

<h2>The dative case</h2>

<p>Use the dative case to indicate an indirect object, which is the person (or thing) for whom (or which) the action in a sentence is performed. Consider this example sentence:</p>

<p>Я дал учителю сочинение. (ya dahl ooh-chee-tee-lyooh sah-chee-nyeh-nee-ee.) (I gave the teacher my essay.)</p>

<p>The word <b>учителю</b> (ooh-chee-tee-lyooh) (teacher) is, in fact, the dative form of the word <b>учитель</b> (ooh-chee-tyehl’). The original dictionary form of the word changes because in this sentence teacher functions as an indirect object. (My essay acts as the direct object, which we cover in the preceding section.) You also use the dative case after certain prepositions, such as к (k) (toward)
and по (poh) (along).</p>

<h2>The instrumental case</h2>

<p>As the name suggests, the instrumental case is often used to indicate the instrument that assists in carrying out an action. So, when you say that you’re writing a letter with a pen, you have to put ручка (roohch-kuh) (pen) in the instrumental case, which is ручкой (roohch-kаhy). You also use the instrumental case after certain prepositions, such as the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>между (myezh-dooh) (between)</p></li>
	<li><p>над (naht) (over)</p></li>
	<li><p>перед (pyeh-reet) (in front of)</p></li>
	<li><p>под (poht) (below)</p></li>
	<li><p>с (s) (with)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>The prepositional case</h2>

<p>The prepositional case is so named because it’s used only after certain prepositions. Older Russian textbooks frequently refer to it as the locative case, because it often indicates the location where an action takes place. No wonder it’s used with the prepositions в (v) (in) and на (nah) (on). The prepositional case is also used after the prepositions o (oh) and oб (ohb), two Russian words that mean about. So when you say to that special someone, I am constantly thinking about you, make sure to put ты (ti) (you; informal singular) in the prepositional case, which is тебе (tee-byeh): Я постоянно думаю о тебе (ya pahs-tah-ya-nuh dooh-muh-yooh uh tee-byeh). By the way, you may wonder why the English preposition about has two different Russian equivalents: <b>o</b> and <b>ob</b>. For your information, you use o if the following word begins with a consonant. You use <b>ob</b> if the following word begins with a vowel.</p>
