<h1>Non-Homeomorphic Spaces</h1>

<p>To prove two topological spaces are homeomorphic we have to find a homeomorphism between them. But, to prove that two topological spaces are not homeomorphic is often much harder as we have to show that no homeomorphism exists. One way is to notice that if two spaces do not share a topological property, then they cannot be homeomorphic.</p>

<p><b>Example</b>. Prove that [0, 2] is not homeomorphic to the subspace [0, 1] ∪ [2, 3] of ℝ.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>. [0,2] is connected, but [0,1] \cup [2,3] is not.</p>
