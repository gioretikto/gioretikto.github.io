<h1>Limit points</h1>

<p>On the real number line we have a notion of “closeness”. For example each point in the sequence</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>0.1, .01, .001, .0001, .00001, ...</p>
</div> 

<p>is closer to 0 than the previous one. <br> Indeed, in some sense, 0 is a limit point of this sequence. So the interval (0, 1] is not
closed, as it does not contain the limit point 0. A metric space is a topological space that includes the notion of a metric or distance between its elements but in a general topological space we do not have a metric, so we must proceed differently. We shall define the notion of limit point without resorting to distances. Even with our new definition of limit point, the point 0 will still be a limit point of (0, 1]. The introduction of the notion of limit point will lead us to a much better understanding of the notion of closed set.</p>

<p><b>Definition 1.3.1</b>. (Neighbourhood) In a topological space (<i>X,τ</i>), an open neighbourhood of a point <i>x</i> &in; <i>X</i> is an open set containing <i>x</i>, so that an open set is an open neighbourhood of every point of itself.</p>

<p><b>Definition 1.3.2</b>. Let <i>A</i> be a subset of a topological space (<i>X,τ</i>). A point <i>x</i> ∈ <i>X</i> is said to be a <b>limit point</b> (or <i>accumulation point</i> or <i>cluster point</i>) of <i>A</i> (that is not necessarily in A) if every open set, <i>U</i>, containing <i>x</i> contains a point of <i>A</i> different from <i>x</i>. Symbolically we can say that <i>x</i> is a limit point of <i>A</i> if for every open neighborhood <i>U<sub>x</sub></i> of <i>x</i>, we have</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>U<sub>x</sub></i> ∩ (<i>A</i> \{<i>x</i>}) ≠ ∅.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Example 1.3.3</b>. Consider the topological space (<i>X,τ</i>) where the set <i>X</i> = {<i>a, b, c, d, e</i>} , the topology <i>τ</i> = {<i>X</i>, Ø, {<i>a</i>}, {<i>c, d</i>}, {<i>a, c, d</i>}, {<i>b, c, d, e</i>}}, and <i>A</i> = {<i>a, b, c</i>}. Then <i>b, d</i>, and <i>e</i> are limit points of <i>A</i> but <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> are not limit points of <i>A</i>.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>The set {<i>a</i>} is open and contains no other point of <i>A</i>. So a is not a limit point of <i>A</i>.</p></li>
	<li><p>The set {<i>c, d</i>} is an open set containing c but no other point of <i>A</i>. So <i>c</i> is not a limit point of <i>A</i>.</p></li>
	<li><p>The only open sets containing <i>b</i> are <i>X</i> and {<i>b, c, d, e</i>} and both contain another element of <i>A</i>, namely <i>c</i>. So <i>b</i> is a limit point of <i>A</i>.</p></li>
	<li><p>The point <i>d</i> is a limit point of A , even though it is not in <i>A</i>. This is so since every open set containing <i>d</i> contains a point of <i>A</i>. Similarly <i>e</i> is a limit point of <i>A</i> even though it is not in <i>A</i>. &emsp;■</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Example 1.3.4</b>. Consider the subset <i>A</i> = [<i>a, b</i>) of ℝ. Then it is easily verified that every element in [<i>a, b</i>) is a limit point of <i>A</i>. The point <i>b</i> is also a limit point of <i>A</i>. &emsp;■</p>

<p>The next proposition provides a useful way of testing whether a set is closed or not.</p>

<p><b>Proposition 1.3.5</b>. A subset <i>A</i> of a space <i>X</i> is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points (of <i>A</i>). In other words, iff the complement <i>X</i>\<i>A</i> of <i>A</i> contains no limit points of <i>A</i>. </p>

<p><b>Proof</b>. Assume that <i>A</i> is closed in (<i>X, τ</i>). Suppose that <i>x</i> is a limit point of <i>A</i> which belongs to <i>X</i> \ <i>A</i>. Then <i>X</i> \ <i>A</i> is an open set containing the limit point <i>x</i> of <i>A</i>. Therefore <i>X</i> \ <i>A</i> contains an element of <i>A</i>. This is clearly false and so we have a contradiction to our supposition. Therefore every limit point of A must belong to <i>A</i>. <br> Conversely, assume that <i>A</i> contains all of its limit points. For each <i>z</i> ∈ <i>X</i> \ <i>A</i>, our assumption implies that there exists an open set <i>U<sub>z</sub></i> ∋ <i>z</i> such that <i>U<sub>z</sub></i> ∩ <i>A</i> = Ø; This is because if <i>z</i> were a limit point we'd have <i>U<sub>z</sub></i> ∩ (<i>A</i> \{<i>z</i>}) ≠ ∅; negating this condition knowing that <i>A</i> \ {<i>z</i>} = <i>A</i> we have <i>U<sub>z</sub></i> ∩ <i>A</i> = Ø. Now if two subsets are disjoint, then each one is contained in the complement of the other that is, <i>U<sub>z</sub></i> ⊆ <i>X</i> \ <i>A</i>. Therefore <i>X</i> \ <i>A</i> = ⋃<sub><sub><i>z</i> ∈ <i>X</i>\<i>A</i></sub></sub> <i>U<sub>z</sub></i>. So <i>X</i> \ <i>A</i> is a union of open sets and hence is open. Consequently its complement, <i>A</i>, is closed. &emsp;□</p>

<p><b>Example 1.3.6</b>. As applications of Proposition 1.3.5 we have the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>the set [<i>a, b</i>) is not closed in ℝ, since <i>b</i> is a limit point and <i>b</i> &notin; [<i>a, b</i>);</p></li>
	<li><p>the set [<i>a, b</i>] is closed in ℝ, since all the limit points of [<i>a, b</i>] (namely all the elements of [<i>a, b</i>]) are in [<i>a, b</i>];</p></li>
	<li><p>(<i>a, b</i>) is not a closed subset of ℝ, since it does not contain the limit point <i>a</i>;</p></li>
	<li><p>([<i>a</i>, ∞) is a closed subset of ℝ.&emsp;■</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The set of all limit points of a set <i>A</i> is called the <i>derived set</i> of the set <i>A</i> and denoted by <i>A'</i>.</p>

<p><b>Nota bene</b>. In general a limit point for <i>A</i>, needs not to be a point in <i>A</i>.</p>

<p><b>Proposition 1.3.6</b>. For any set <i>A</i> &subset; <i>X</i>, the set <i>A</i> &cup; <i>A'</i> is closed.</p>

<p><b>Proof</b>. We shall show that the set <i>X</i>\(<i>A</i> &cup; <i>A'</i>) is open. Let <i>x</i> be an arbitrary point from <i>X</i>\(<i>A</i> &cup; <i>A'</i>). Then <i>x</i> is neither in <i>A</i> nor a limit point of <i>A</i>. If <i>x</i> is not a limit point of <i>A</i> the negation of the limit point property (def.1.3.2) <i>U<sub>x</sub></i> ∩ (<i>A</i> \{<i>x</i>}) ≠ ∅ must be true, i.e. there exists a neighborhood <i>U<sub>x</sub></i> of <i>x</i> that does not intersect neither <i>A</i> nor <i>A'</i>. Hence <i>U<sub>x</sub></i> is disjoint from <i>A</i> and <i>A'</i>, thus we conclude that <i>U<sub>x</sub></i> ⊆ <i>X</i>\(<i>A</i> &cup; <i>A'</i>). Given the arbitrary of <i>x</i> we can find other open sets for all points in <i>X</i>\(<i>A</i> &cup; <i>A'</i>), whose union must be the open 
open set <i>X</i>\(<i>A</i> &cup; <i>A'</i>). This proves <i>A</i> &cup; <i>A'</i> is closed, as desired. &emsp;□</p>

<p><b>Definition 1.3.7</b>. Let the set <i>A</i> be a subset of a topological space (<i>X,τ</i>). Then the set <i>A</i> &cup; <i>A'</i> consisting of <i>A</i> and all its limit points is called the <b>closure of A</b> and is denoted by <i><b>Ā</b>,</i>.</p>

<p>Every closed set containing <i>A</i> must also contain the set <i>A'</i>. So <i>A</i> ∪ <i>A'</i> = <i>Ā</i> is the smallest closed set containing <i>A</i>. This implies that <i>Ā</i> is the intersection of all closed sets containing A.</p>

<p><b>Definition 1.3.8</b>. Let <i>A</i> be a subset of a topological space (<i>X,τ</i>). Then <i>A</i> is said to be <b>dense</b> in <i>X</i> or <b>everywhere dense</b> in <i>X</i> if <i>Ā</i> = <i>X</i>.</p>
