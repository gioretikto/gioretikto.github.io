Before proceeding we give a brief historical account on the developments leading up to the formulation of the solutions of cubic equations.</p>

<p>The mathematics of the 16th century was geometrically based so that a term <i>x</i><sup>3</sup> actually represented a cube with side of <i>x</i>. Mathematicians at that time wrote the equations so that all coefficients were positive. It is clear that if in 5.8.1 <i>a, b</i> and <i>c</i> are all positive, the equation will have no geometric solution (<i>i.e.</i> not real positive solutions). If only positive coefficients and positive values of <i>x</i> are allowed, then there are three cases:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>x</i><sup>3</sup> + <i>px</i> = <i>q</i><br>
<i>x</i><sup>3</sup> = <i>px</i> + <i>q</i><br>
<i>x</i><sup>3</sup> + <i>q</i> = <i>px</i></p>
</div>

<p>These three types are today subsumed under the single equation <i>x</i><sup>3</sup> + <i>bx</i> + <i>c</i> = 0, where the coefficients <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> may denote any numbers (rather than only positive as in Cardano's time).</p>

<p>The solution of the first case, was obtained around 1515 by Scipione del Ferro, professor of mathematics in Bologna. His solution was never published, although after his death in 1526, his method passed to some of his pupils. The second discovery of the solution is better documented, through the accounts of its author, Niccolò Fontana (c. 1499-1557) better known as Tartaglia, which translated from the italian means the "stammerer", from Brescia. In 1535, Tartaglia, who had dealt with some very particular cases of cubic equations, was challenged to a public problem-solving contest by Antonio Maria Fior, a former pupil of del Ferro, who had received the solution of the cubic equation, from his master. Tartaglia found the general solution (of the first type above) to the equation posed by del Ferro’s student and won the contest. Shortly afterward, Cardano succeeded in extending the method of solution of cubics of the first type to the remaining two types.</p>

<p>The news that Tartaglia had found the solution of cubic equations reached Girolamo Cardano (1501–1576) from Milan, a polymath scientist, who was planning to write a book on cubic equations and already wrote a number of books on a wide variety of subjects, including astrology, astronomy, medicine, philosophy, and mathematics. Tartaglia initially refused to divulgate the formula, planning himself to write a book on this topic. It turns out that Tartaglia, flattered by Cardano later changed his mind since in 1539 he handed on to Cardano the solution expressing it in verses</p>

<pre>
Quando chel cubo con le cose apresso (When the cube and the things equal to a number)
 Se agualia à qualche numero discreto
 Trouan dui altri differenti in esso
Dapoi terrai questo per consueto
 Ch’el lor produtto sempre sia eguale
 Al terzo cubo delle cose neto
El residuo poi suo generale
 Delli lor lati cubi bene sottratti
 Varra la tua cosa principale.

<p>Cosa (= thing) is the word for the unknown. This excerpt gives the formula for x3 + mx = n. The equation is indicated in the first two verses: .
