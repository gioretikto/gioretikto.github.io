<h1>Exercises on congrueces</h1>

<p><b>Exercise 4.27</b>. Find the solutions (if there exist) of the following congruences:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>3x ≡ 5 &emsp; mod 4</p></li>
	<li><p>3x ≡ 9 &emsp; mod 6</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>Solutions</b>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>(3,5) = 1, so there exists a unique solution. We find first the multiplicative inverse</p>

<p>3x ≡ 1 &emsp; mod 4</p>

<p>We notice that the inverse is 3, so</p>

<p>3·3x ≡ 5·3 &emsp; mod 4</p>

<p>x = 15 &emsp; mod 4</p>

<p>so the solution is x = 3.</p>
</li>

<li><p>gcd(3,6) = 3 | 9. Then there are 3 solutions non congruent mod 6.</p>

<p>3x ≡ 9 &emsp; mod 6. A solution is x<sub>0</sub> = 3.</p>

<p>x<sub>1</sub> = 3 + 6/3 = 5, and x<sub>2</sub> = 3 + 2 · 6/3 = 7. Other non congruent solutions are 1,5,7.</p>

</ol>

<p><b>Exercise 4.28</b>. (<i>Days of the week</i>) Congruences have long been used implicitly to compute dates. As an example, let us determine what day of the week August 18 in the year 2020 will be. To keep track of the days we assign the integers 0, 1, 2, ..., 6 as labels for the days of the week, say Sunday = 0, Monday = 1, ..., Saturday = 6. Suppose that we reckon from July 12, 1987, which was a Sunday. All we have to do is count the number of days from July 12, 1987 to August 18, 2020. Allowing for leap years, this number is 8629. Now 12091 ≡ 2 (mod 7) and 2 is the label for Tuesday. We conclude that August 18, 2020 will be a Tuesday.</p>
