<h1>Scandinavian Defense </h1>

<p>The Scandinavian Defense, formerly better known in English language texts as the Center-Counter, is Black's seventh most popular response to 1.e4. The Scandinavian Defense is one of Black's more offbeat responses to White's 1.e4, where Black immediately attacks the white pawn with 1...d5. This is how it got its old name of the Center Counter, because Black immediately counters in the center.</p>

<p>Easily White's best response, and overwhelmingly its most popular, is to capture with 2.exd5. Although it is Black's first move that defines the Scandinavian, the position after that pawn capture is effectively the starting position for the opening. It's at this point where the Scandinavian really gets interesting.</p>

<p><b>Pros</b></p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Black opens the game immediately</p></li>
	<li><p>Usually both black bishops have freedom</p></li>
	<li><p>A provocative opening</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Cons</b></p>

<ul>
	<li><p>After the capture 2.exd5, Black loses time recapturing</p></li>
	<li><p>Because Black loses some time, he is in danger of a quick knockout</p></li>
	<li><p>White usually has more central space</p></li>
</ul>
