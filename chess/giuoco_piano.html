<h1>Giuoco piano</h1>

<p>The Italian Game is a family of chess openings beginning with the moves:</p>

<pre>
    1. e4 e5
    2. Nf3 Nc6
    3. Bc4
</pre>

<p>The name Giuoco Piano, is often wrongly considered synonymous with the Italian Game. The term <b>Giuoco Piano</b> for the lines where Black replies <b>3...Bc5</b>. <br> The other option for Black is <b>3...Nf6</b>, the <b>Two Knights Defense</b>. They are about equally popular, but the resulting positions usually have a very different character. </p>

<p>The Giuoco Piano (Italian: "Quiet Game"; also called the Italian Opening, is a chess opening beginning with the moves:</p>

<h2>Main line</h2>

<h3>Wilhelm Steinitz vs Curt von Bardeleben<br>"The Battle of Hastings" (game of the day Feb-23-2016)<br>Hastings (1895), Hastings ENG, rd 10, Aug-17 </h3>

<p>Both sides have brought out a Knight and a Bishop, the Bishops bear down on the vulnerable f-Pawns, and White is ready to castle. The most exciting play can follow if White now continues with <b>4 c3</b>. White prepares to form a big centre of Pawns with <i>5 d4</i>, which would also gain time by attacking the Black Bishop. Note too that <i>4 c3</i> opens a diagonal for the Queen and introduces possibilities of <i>Qb3</i> adding to the attack on <i>f7</i>. Let us continue with the main line of analysis:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>... <b>Nf6</b></p>
</div>

<p>Black brings out another piece, attacks the e-Pawn and prepares to castle. Note that now 5 Ng5 would get White nowhere since 5 ... O-O defends the f-Pawn adequately. </p>

<p>Common alternatives to 3...Bc5 include 3...Nf6 (the Two Knights Defence) and 3...Be7 (the Hungarian Defence). Much less common are 3...d6 (the Semi-Italian Opening), 3...g6, 3...Nd4 (the Blackburne Shilling Gambit), and 3...f5 (the Rousseau Gambit). </p>

<h2>Variations</h2>

<p>The main continuations on White's fourth move are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>4.c3, the Main line, see below.</p></li>
    <li><p>4.b4, the Evans Gambit, in which White offers a pawn to speed his development. This opening was popular <li><p>in the 19th century, more than the standard Giuoco Piano.</p></li>
    <li><p>4.d3, the Giuoco Pianissimo, see below.</p></li>
    <li><p>4.0-0, often with the intention of meeting 4...Nf6 with 5.d4, the Max Lange Gambit, with similar ideas to the Italian Gambit but with some transpositional differences.</p></li>

<p>Other continuations are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>4.Nc3 Nf6, the Four Knights Variation.</p></li>
    <li><p>4.d4, the Italian Gambit, in which White opens up the centre, avoiding the quiet lines of the Giuoco Piano and Giuoco Pianissimo.</p></li>
    <li><p>4.Bxf7+? Kxf7 5.Nxe5+ Nxe5, the Jerome Gambit, an unsound opening where White sacrifices two pieces in the hope of exposing Black's king and obtaining a mating attack.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>1 e4</b> Excellent opening move. White anchors a pawn in the center and opens lines for his queen and bishop.</p>

<p><b>1 .. e5</b> Very Good! Black insists on a fair share of the centre and liberates two of his pieces.</p>

<p><b>2 Nf3!</b> The Knight comes into play early in the game, in compliance with the precept: develop knights before bishops! </p>

<p><b>3 Bc4</b> "The best attacking piece is the king's bishop" says Tarrash, so White puts this pieces to work and clears the way for early castling.</p>


<p><b>3 Bc5</b> On this excellent square the bishop commands an important diagonal, exerts pressure on the centre and attacks a weak pawn. This deployment conforms to two golden rules for opening play:</p>

<blockquote><i>Place each piece as quickly as possible on the square where it is most effective</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Move each piece only once in the opening</i>.</blockquote>

<p><b>4 c3</b> White's primary object is to establish two pawns in the centre and with this move he intends to support an advance of the d-pawn. In advancing to c3, the pawn occupies a square that should be reserved for the b1-knight.</p>

<p><b>4 ... Qe7</b> Very good! Black develops a piece while parrying the threat. If White persists in playing 5 d4, the continuation 5 ..exd4 cxd4 Qxe4+ wins a pawn.</p>

<p><b>5 0-0</b> White postpones the advance of the d-pawn and moves his king to a safer place.</p>

<p><b>5 ... d6</b> Strengthens the centre and supports the e-pawn and bishop. Now the c8-bishop can get into the game.</p>

<blockquote><i>Castle early in the game, preferably on the kingside.</i></blockquote>

<p><b>6 d4</b> With the hope that Black will exchange paws. This would leave White with an impressive line-up in the centre, while the c3-square is then available for his knight. If now 6...exd4 7 exd4 Qxe4, White punishes the pawn-snatching by 8 Re1 pinning the queen.</p>

<p><b>6 ... Bb6</b> But Black need not capture! Now that his e-pawn is secure, the bishop simply retreats, still bearing down on the white centre from its new position. Despite its formidable appearance. White's pawn-centre is haky. The d-pawn is attacked three times, and White must keep a triple guard on it while trying to comple his development.</p>

<p><b>7 a4</b> White threatens an attack on the bishopt by 8 a5. If then 8...Bxa5 8 d5 strikes at the knight protecting the bishop. After reply 9 ... Nd8 White captures by 10 Rxa5.</p>

<p><b>7 ... a6</b> Black prepares a retreat for his bishop.</p>

<p><b>8 a5</b> Thre is just a wee change that Blck will be tempted to take the pawn.</p>

<p><b>8 ... Ba7</b> But Black does not bite!</p>

<p><b>9 h3</b> A coffe-house move! Weak players make this move instinctively in dire dread of having a piece pinned. Playing h3 or g3 after clastling creates an organic weakness that can never be remedied.</p>

<p><b>9 ... Nf6</b> The knight swing into the fray with an attack on the e-pawn. This move conforms with a useful principle.</p>

<blockquote><i>Develop with a threat whenever possible!</i></blockquote>

<p><b>10 dxe5</b> White exchanges, and opens up line for his pieces. Unfortunately this reacts in Black's favour, in accordance with the rule in these cases:</p>

<blockquote><i>Open lines are to the advantage of the player whose development is superior</i>.</blockquote>

<p><b>10 ... Nxe5</b> Much stronger than taking with the pawn. The knight on e5 beautifully centralized, radiates power in every direction. The disappearance of White's d pawn has benefited Black's bishop, hidden away at a7. </p>

<p><b>11 Nxe5</b> This looks plausible, as White gets rid of a powerfully placed piece, but in making this exchange, White's own f3-knight, <i>the best defender of the castled position</i>, also comes off the board.</p>

<p><b>11 ... Qe5</b> The Queen dominates the centre attacking the e-pawn.</p>

<p><b>12 Nd2</b> Desperately hoping that Black will snatch up the pawn by 12...Nxe4, whene there would follow 13 Nxe4 Qxe4 14 Re1, and the pin wins the quees.</p>

<p><b>12 ... Bxh3</b> But Black is not interested in grabbing paws. His positional superiority is great enough to justify looking for a combination that will conclusevely force a win. Yes indeed! The h-pawn, which innocently move to h3 to precent a pin!</p>

<p><b>13 gxh3</b> White must capture the bishop or be a pawn down with nothing to show for it.</p>

<p><b>13 ... Qg3+!</b> A crashing entrance! Notice how Black has exploited the two main defect of 9. h3 he captured  the h-pawn itself and utilized the g3-squre, weakenes by its advance, as a point of invasion.</p>

<p><b>14 Kh1</b> White may not take the queen, as his f-pawn is pinned</p>

<p><b>14 ... Qxh3+</b> Black destroys another defending pawn, further exposing the king.</p>

<p><b>15 Kg1</b> White's only move</p>

<p><b>15 ... Ng4</b> Threatens mate on the move. White must guard against the threat at h2 or five his king a flight.square.</p>

<p><b>16 Nf3</b> To guard h2 and stop mate by the queen</p>

<p><b>16 ... Qg3+</b> Again exploiting the circumstance that the f-pawn is pinned. Black attacks it with a third piece, the queen.</p>

<p><b>17 ... Bxf2</b> Covers the king's flight-square g1 and prevents him from returning there in answer to check.</p>

<p><b>0-1</b></p>

<p><b>1 e4</b> Best move on the board; A pawn occupies the centre and two pieces are freed for action.</p>

<p><b>1 ... e5</b> "Probably the best reply says Capablanca". Black equalized the pressure in the centre and free his queen and a bishop.</p>

<p><b>2 Nf3</b> the g1-knight comes into play with attack. Whatever the answer is he cannot dawdle.</p>

<p><b>2 ... Nc6</b> Undoubtedly the lofical move. The pawn is protected without loss of time and the b8-knight is developed to its best post in the opening in one move.</p>

<p><b>3 Bc4</b> Excellent since the bishop seizes. The bishopo strikes at f7, <i>Black's weakest point</i>. A bishop is utilized to greates effect either in controlling an important diagonal or in pinning (and rendering useless) an enemy piece.</p>

<p><b>3 ... Bc5</b> 3... Nf6 is a good alternative.</p>

<p><b>4 c3</b> White's intentions are clear: he wants to support a pawn advance in the centre. His next move 5 d4 will attack pawn and bishop. To save his e-pawn, Black will be forced to play 5... exd4. The recapture by 6 cxd4 will give White a strong formation of pawns in the centre.</p>

<p><b>4... Bb6!</b> Threats must be parried before continuing development.</p>

<p><b>5 d4</b> Hoping to induce Black to exchange pawns.</p>

<p><b>5... Qe7</b> Instead of exchanging paws, Black defends his e-pawn while bringing anothe piece into play. In addition to this Black's last move threatens to continue 6 ... exd4 7 cxd4 Qxe4+, winning a pawn.</p>

<p><b>6 0-0</b> Besides the usual benefits derived from castling White's move indirectly protects his e-pawn. If Black tries 6 ... exd4 7 cxd4 Qxe4+ then 8 Re1 pins and wins the queen.</p>

<p><b>7 d5</b> Tempting as it will dislodge the c6-knight from its strong post. This move in natura, but to be censured on several counts: 1) The d-pawn blocks the path of White's own c4-bishop. 2) The range of Black's b6-bishop has been increased; 3) White has moved a pawm while his queenside pieces are crying to be released.</p>

<p><b>7.... Nb8</b> Retreat is safer than moving the knight to the side of the board. After 7... na5 White's response is ( d3 after which he threatens to win the awkwardly places knight by 9 b4.</p>

<p><b>8 Bd3</b> Defends the e-pawn but hte development of another pieces is more consistent with opening strategy. Either 8 Nbd3 or 8 Qe2 protects the pawn while bringing one more piece into play. And then <i>Do not move the same piece twice in the opening</i>.  It is interesting to see how Black punishes these infraction of principles.</p>

<p><b>8 ... d6</b> This move strengthens the centre, opens a path for the c8.bishop and relieves the queen of the burden of watching over the e-pawn.</p>

<p><b>9 h3</b> To prevent Black from pinning his knight by 9... Bg4, but as Publius Syrus observed some considerable time ago, "There are some remedies worse that the disease". White weakness organically the structure of the kingside castled position and sets up the unfortunate h-pawn itseld as a convenient target for direct attack.</p>

<p><b>9 ... h6 </b> Black plays a move similar to the one I have severely censured! The h-pawn will constiture a base for the g-pawn, which will march up to g5 and the g4.</p>

<p><b>10 Qe2</b> A developing move, but it may be to late</p>

<p><b>10 ... g5!</b> A bayonet thrust! The next step is to g4, where the pawn will break up White's position.</p>

<p><b>11 Nh2</b> To prevend the intende advance. Has Black's plan miscarried?</p>

<p><b>11 ... g4!</b> Not at all! If necessary. Black will sacrifice a pawn for the sake of ripping away the defensive screen around White's king.</p>

<p><b>12 hxg4</b> Pratically forces, as Black was threatening 12 ... gxh3, as well as 12... g3</p>

<p><b>12 ... Rg8</b> Now it is Black who attacks the g-pawn three times, while only two pieces defend it!</p>

<p><b>13 Bxh6</b> Desperately snatching at a loose pawn. But <i>Do not grab pawns at the expense of development or position</i></p>

<p><b>13 ... Nxg4</b> Gaining time by threatening the bishop among other things</p>

<p><b>14 Be3</b> The bishop flees and attempts to repel one of the assailants</p>

<p><b>14 ... Nxh2</b> This capture greatly limits White's choice of reply.</p>

<p><b>15 Qh4+</b> Black has two major pieces operating with full force on the two open files near the enemy king.</p>

<p><b>16 kg1</b> White's only move</p>

<p><b>16 .... Qh3</b> Threatening mate on the move</p>

<p><b>0-1</b> Thre is no defence that will postpone the mate for long.</p>

pgnView('Ruger', {pgn: pgn});
</script>

<p><b>1. e4</b> The most important target in the opening is to develop the pieces as fast as possible in order to occupy and control the centre. White's first move fixes a pawn in the centre and, as the first step in getting his pieces off the back rank, opens avenues for his queen and bishop.</p>

<p><b>1 ... e5</b> Black equalizes the pressure in the centre and releases two pieces for action. He must be content with this, as he cannot hope at this early stage to wrest the initiative away from White by force.</p>

<p><b>2. Nf3</b> It is good strategy to make developing moves that embody threats, as it cuts down the choice of reply.</p>

<p><b>2 ... Nc6</b> Black saves his e-pawn and develops a piece. The knight comes into play efficiently: its action is directed toward infcluencing the centre. It defends the e5-pawn and attacks d4.</p>

<p><b>3 Bc4</b> The bishop comes out, taking up a post where it commands a diagonal leading towards Black's king. It attacks a pawn which is peculiarly vulnerable as it is defendend only by the king.</p>

<p><b>3 ... Bc5</b> Black follows suit, bringing his bishop out to the most suitable square. In the opening, a bishop is best placed for attack when it controls a diagonal passing through the centre or when it pins a hostile knight and renders it immobile.</p>

<p><b>4. c3</b> Supporting an advance of the d-pawn with a view to controlling the centre. White postpones castling as his king is in no danger.</p>

<p><b>4 ... Nf6</b> A powerful counter to the threat: Black develops a piece and attacks a pawn.</p>

<p><b>5. d4</b> White meets this by attacking a piece.</p>

<p><b>5 ... exd4</b> Pratically forced, since 5... Bd6 guarding the e-pawn is clumsy, since it blocks the d-pawn, while 5... Bb6 permits 6 dxe5 Nxe4 7. xf7+ Kxf7 8. Qd5+ and White regains his piece.</p>

<p><b>6. cxd4</b> White's array of paswn looks impressive, but can the centre be maintained?</p>

<p><b>6... Bb4+</b> </p>

<p><b>7 Nc3</b> White prefers this, which offers a pawn, to 7 Bd2 Bxd2, when the e-pawn is protected.</p>

<p><b>7... O-O</b> "Chess is not for timid sould" wrote Steinitz in a letter to Bachmann. Castling early in the game is <i>generally</i> sound strategy. In this case it is inappropriate, as White's centre is formidable and must be destroyed. Black must play 7... Nxe4, accepting the offer of a pawn, and take his chances of surviving Whatever attack might follow. It cannot be worse than this passive castling, which result in both his knights being evicted from their fine posts. Pillsbury gave as his rule, which he sais was absolute and vital: "Castle because you want to or because you must, but not because you can".</p>

<p><b>8 d5</b> Ordinarly, such moves are susperct, as d5 should be occupied by a piece, but here the pawn dislodges the knight and prevents Black forever from freeing his game by ...d5</p>

<p><b>8 ... Ne7</b> As good as there is. The shift to a5 is counted by 9. Bd3, and the knight is stranded at the side of the board.</p>

<p><b>9. e5</b> Now a shot at the other knight!</p>

<p><b>9 ... Ne4</b> Retreating to e8 does not look attractive, so Black plays to exchange knights.</p>

<p><b>10. Qc2</b> Protects his own knight, which was twice attacked, and threatens the enemy's.</p>

<p><b>10 ... Nxc3</b> Pratically forced, as defending the knight by 10...f5 allows 11 d6+ and the other knight falls.</p>

<p><b>11 bxc3</b> This recapture gains a tempo: Black's bishop must lose a move retreating, while White's advantages multiply. Now he enjoys an open b-file for his rook and an extra diagonal for his dark-squared bishop.</p>

<p><b>11. Bc5</b> Naturally this offers better chances tha moving to a5, the only other flight square.</p>

<p><b>12. Ng5!</b> ostensibly to scare Black by the threat of mate; actually, the purpose is to induce a weakining advance of one of the king's retinue of pawns.</p>

<p><b>12 ... Ng6</b> The only efence. The kingside pawns remain intact, but Black has been compelled to place his pieces where White wants them. Under such circumstances the chances of Black putting up a good fight are not too bright</p>

<p><b>13 h4</b> Threatening to move on to h5, dislodging the knight, and then mate with the queen.</p>

<p><b>13. ... h6</b> What else is there? Black triees to drive off the menancig knight. He cannot do this by 13 ... f6 as 14 d6+ Kh8 15 Nf7+ wins the exchange.</p>

<p><b>14 d6!</b> A poweful stroke! Black's bishop is cut off from the defence, while a line is opened for White's bishop. White now threatens 15. Qxg6, as the pinned f-pawn could not capture the queen.</p>

<p><b>14 ... hxg5</b> Black might as well take whatever material he can.</p>

<p><b>15. hxg5!</b> The knight will not run away (the penality being 16 Qh7#). Meanwhile, the rook has lovely open file, and the queen still threatens to capture.</p>

<p><b>15 ... Re8</b> The king needs more room!</p>

<p><b>16 Qxg6</b> Regaining the piece without relaxing the pressure. White threatens one mate in one, and two mates in two.</p>

<p><b>16 ... Rxe5</b> Black consoles himself by equalazing the material and gives one despairing check before he yields.</p>
