<h1>Queen's Gambit Accepted</h1>

<pre>1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4</pre>

<p>The Queen's Gambit Accepted can be a safe way of playing against 2.c4 if Black knows what to do. After taking the pawn with <b>2...cxd4</b>, Black should not try to hold on to it but instead focus on developing their pieces while White recaptures the pawn. <br> Black's light-squared bishop, which is usually a problem in the Queen's Gambit Declined, usually finds a good spot on b7 or g4 in this variation. Black will also try to force White to accept an isolated d-pawn, which could become a target.</p>

<p><b>Main Line</b>. 1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.e3 e6 5.Bxc4 c5 6.O-O a6</p>

<div id="main" style="width: 1000px"></div>
<script>
var pgn = '1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.e3 e6 5.Bxc4 c5 6.O-O a6'; 
pgnView('main', {pgn: pgn});
</script>

<p><b>3.Nf3</b>: White delays their play to recapture the pawn, and prevents …e5.</p>

<p><b>.. Nf6</b>: Black’s most popular response, which White most popularly follows with <b>4.e3</b>, attacking the c4-pawn.</p>

<p>The main lines of the QGA begin with this move. White delays measures to regain the pawn for the moment and prevents Black from striking at the centre with ...e5. The recovery of the pawn will usually be done through 4.e3 and 5.Bxc4. Black's most common rejoinder is 3...Nf6, though the variation 3...a6 was introduced by Alexander Alekhine and bears his name. </p>

<h2>Traps</h2>

<p>Black should not try to defend the pawn in c4 with another pawn in b5, as it could loose a rook as shown below.</p>

<div id="trap" style="width: 1000px"></div>
<script>
var pgn = '1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.e3 b5 4. a4 c6 5. axb5 cxb5 6. Qf3'; 
pgnView('trap', {pgn: pgn});
