<p>Lagrange's equation were formulated by the 18th century mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange in his book <i>MÃ©canique Analytique</i> published in 1788, nearly a century after the appearance of Newton's <i>Principia</i>. In its original form Lagrange's equation made it possible to set up Newton's equations of motion, F = dp/dt, easily in terms of any set of genelarized coordinates, that is, any set of variable capable of specifying the positions of all particles in the system. The generalized coordinates subsume the rectangular Cartesian coordinates, of course, but also include angular coordinates such as those in the plane polar or spherical polar coordinates. The generalized coordinates also allow us to deal easily with constraints of motion, such as a ball constrained to move always in contact with the interior surface of a hemisphere; 

<p>We have two categories of constraints:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><b>Geometric constraint</b>: Only the positions of the particles of a system are restricted. For example, the coordinates of the particle <i>m</i>, constrained by a rigid rod, <i>x,y,z</i> should satisfy the following equation</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>z</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>l</i><sup>2</sup></p>
</div>

<p>Therefore the coordinates of the particle <i>m</i> at any instant of time <i>t</i>, <i>x</i>(<i>t</i>),<i>y</i>(<i>t</i>), <i>z</i>(<i>t</i>), are not independent. Only two of them are independent.</p>

</li>

<li><p><b>Kinematic constraint</b>: Both the position and velocity of the particles of a system are restricted. For example if a cylinder moves along the positive direction of the <i>x</i> axis, then the position of th center of the cylinder <i>C</i> must satisfy the following relationship (a geometric constraint)</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>z<sub>C</sub></i> = <i>R</i></p>
</div>

<p>where <i>z<sub>C</sub></i> is the position of the center of the cylinder along the <i>z</i> axis, and <i>R</i> is the radius of the cylinder. 

</ul>

<p>Suppose a mechanical system has <i>n</i> coordinates <i>q<sub>i</sub></i> (<i>i</i> = 1, ..., <i>n</i>), then geometric, or holonomic, constraints have the form:</p>





<p>Holonomic constraints arise from geometric constraints and are integrable into a form involving only coordinates (holo comes from Greek that means whole, integer). The relationship specified by a contraint can be an explicity function of time designated as rheonomic constraints (<i>rheo</i>, Gr. hard, inflexible, independent) or not, being designated by scleronomic constraints (<i>scleros</i>, Gr. flexible, changing). 

<p>where <i>l</i> represents the length of the rigid rod.

An important distinction between constraints is whether they are <b>holonomic</b> or <b>non-holonomic</b>. The most general constrain can be written to be a function of the position, velocity and time <i>&phi;</i>(<i>t,q,v</i>) (i.e. it is a differential equation). IF we can write <i>v</i> = <i>v</i>(<i>q</i>), then the </p>

According to Hamilton's Principle, "the actual path taken by a dynamical system is the one that minimizes the time integral of the Lagrangian function out of all possible paths that it can take within a given time interval to switch configuration"
