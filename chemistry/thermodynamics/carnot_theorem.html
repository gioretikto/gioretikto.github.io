<h1>Carnot's theorem</h1>

<p>The second law of thermodynamics shows that given a source of heat, only a portion of the heat can be converted to work in a heat-work cycle. The rest must be rejected to a heat sink. Thus, it is impossible to have a heat engine that is 100% efficient and even the most perfect cycle must be less 1. Carnot's theorem, also known as Carnot's rule, or the Carnot principle, can be stated as follows:</p>

   <blockquote><p>No heat engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a reversible heat engine operating between the same two reservoirs.</p></blockquote>

<p>The simplest way to prove this theorem is to consider the scenario shown below, in which we have an irreversible engine, E<sub>A</sub> as well as a reversible engine, E<sub>B</sub> operating between the same reservoirs <i>T<sub>H</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>C</sub></i>. They both draw the same amount of heat <i>Q<sub>H</sub> = Q<sub>HB</sub> = Q<sub>HA</sub></i>from the high temperature reservoir, assuming the irreversible heat engine to possess higher efficiency than the reversible one <i>&eta;<sub>A</sub> &gt; &eta;<sub>B</sub></i></p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>W<sub>A</sub>/ Q<sub>HA</sub> &gt; W<sub>B</sub>/Q<sub>HB</sub></i></P>
</div>

<p>then the irreversible engine produces more work: <i>W<sub>A</sub> &gt; W<sub>B</sub></i> than that of the reversible engine, while exchanging heat with a single reservoir T<sub>L</sub>. </p>

<p>Note that the reversible engine by its nature can operate in reverse, <i>i.e.</i> if we use some of the work output (<i>W<sub>A</sub></i> equal to <i>W<sub>B</sub></i>) from the irreversible engine in order to drive the reversible engine then it will operate as a heat pump, transferring heat Q<sub>H</sub> to the high temperature reservoir, as shown in the diagram. This violates the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law, by producing a net work <i>W<sub>A</sub> = W<sub>B</sub></i> while exchanging heat with a single reservoir at <i>T<sub>L</sub></i>. Hence the assumption that <i>&eta;<sub>A</sub> &gt; &eta;<sub>B</sub></i> is wrong.</p></p>

<h2>Corollary of carnot's theorem</h2>

<blockquote><p>All reversible heat engines operating between the same two heat reservoirs must have the same efficiency.</p></blockquote>

<p>If we refer to the same diagram above, but with both engines E<sub>A</sub> and E<sub>B</sub> be reversible. Let us assume <i>&eta;<sub>A</sub> &gt; &eta;<sub>B</sub></i>. Similarly to the procedure outlined in the previous section, if E<sub>B</sub> is reverse to run say, as a heat pump using some part of the work output W<sub>A</sub> of heat engine, E<sub>A</sub>, wee see that the combined system of het pump, E<sub>B</sub>, becomes a perpetual motion machine of type two. So <i>&eta;<sub>A</sub></i> cannot be greater than <i>&eta;<sub>B</sub></i>. Therefore</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&eta;<sub>A</sub> = <i>&eta;<sub>B</sub></i></p>
</div>

<p>Since the efficiencies of all reversible rengines operating between the same reservoirs are the same, the efficiency of a reversible engine is independent of the nature of the working substance undergoing the cycle.</p>
