<h1>The Helmholtz Energy</h1>

<h2>Maximum work</h2>

<p>Starting with the first law:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>d<i>U</i> = &delta;<i>q</i> + &delta;<i>w</i></p>
</div>

<p>because d<i>S</i> &ge; &delta;<i>q</i>/<i>T</i>, we can rewrite the equation above as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>d<i>U</i> &minus; <i>T</i>d<i>S</i> &le; &delta;<i>w</i></p>
</div>

<p>If d<i>T</i> = 0 (that is form an isothermal change), this can be written as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>d(<i>U</i> &minus; <i>TS</i>) &le; &delta;<i>w</i></p>
</div>

<p>If we define the <b>Helmholtz energy</b> as</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>A ≡ U &minus; TS</i></p>
</div>

<p>Because the quantity inside the parenthesis is the definition of <i>A</i>, we can substitute:</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>d<i>A</i> &le; &delta; <i>w</i></p>
</div>

<p>which integrated yields to</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&Delta;<i>A</i> &le; <i>w</i> &emsp; (4.1)</p>
</div>

<p>This says that the isothermal change in <i>A</i> is less than or, for reversible changes, equal to the work done by the system on the surrounding. Because work done <i>by</i> the system has a negative value, equation 4.1 means that the &Delta;<i>A</i> of an isothermal process is the maximum <i>amount</i> of work, a system can do on the surroundings. The conenction between work and the Helmholtz energy is the reason that <i>A</i> is represented by <i>A</i> from <i>Arbeit</i>, meaning "work".</p>

<p>The "<i>T</i>d<i>S</i>" term in the definition of d<i>A</i> and d<i>G</i> represents the amount of internal energy or enthalpy that is tied up in random molecular energy states, and so is not avalable to perform work of any sort, whether it be pressure-volume work or non-<i>PV</i> work. It is also why <i>A</i> and <i>G</i> are sometimes referred to as Helmholtz free energy and <i>Gibbs free energy</i>, repsectevely. It is the amount of energy that is "free" to do work. </p>

<p>If the change occurs with an increase of entropy of the system (in which case <i>T</i>∆<i>S</i> &gt; 0), the right-hand side of the equation is more negative than ∆<i>U</i>. In this case, the maximum work that can be obtained from the system is greater than ∆<i>U</i>. The explanation of this apparent paradox is that the system is not isolated and energy may flow in as heat as work is done. Because the entropy of the system increases, we can afford a reduction of the entropy of the surroundings yet still have, overall, a spontaneous process. Therefore, some energy (no more than the value of <i>T</i>∆<i>S</i>) may leave the surroundings as heat and contribute to the work the change is generating.</p>

<h2>Criteria for spontaneity</h2>

<p>The Clausius inequality implies a number of criteria for spostaneuous changer under a variety of conditions that may be expressed in terms of the properties of the system; They are summarized by introducting the Helmholtz and Gibbs energies.</p>

<p>When a change in the system occurs and there is a transfer of energy as heat between the system and the surroundings, the <a href="clausius_inequality.html">Clausius inequality</a>, reads</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>d<i>S</i> &minus; d<i>q</i>/<i>T</i> &ge; 0</p>
</div>

<p>If we consider a closed system with only <i>P-V</i> work, d<i>q</i> = d<i>U</i> + <i>P</i>d<i>V</i> so that at constant volume d<i>q<sub>V</sub></i> = d<i>U</i>. Consequently</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>d<i>S</i> &minus; d<i>U</i>/<i>T</i> &ge; 0</p>
</div>

<p>At either constant internal energy (d<i>U</i> = 0) or constant entropy (d<i>S</i> = 0), this expression becomes, respectively,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>d<i>S<sub>U,V</sub></i> &ge; 0, &emsp; d<i>U<sub>V,S</sub></i> &le; 0 &emsp; (constant <i>V</i>, no additional work)</p>
</div>

<p>Recall that ‘additional work’ is work other than expansion work. The first is the basis for saying that in a spontaneuous process in an isolated system the entropy increases to a maximum.</p>

<p>The second says that if an infinitesimal change takes place in a system of constant volume and entropy, d<i>U</i> is negative if the change is spontaneous and zero if the change is reversible. Do not interpret this criterion as a tendency of the system to collapse to lower energy. Is is a disguised statement abount entropy and it implies that if the entropy of the system is unchanged, then there must be an increase in entropy of the surroundings, which can be achieved only if the energy of the system decreases as energy flows out as heat.</p>

<p>When energy is transferred as heat at constant pressure, and there is no work other than expansion work, we can write d<i>q<sub>P</sub></i> = d<i>H</i> and obtain</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>T</i>d<i>S</i> &ge; d<i>H</i> &emsp; (constant <i>P</i>, no additional work)</p>
</div>

<p>At either constant enthalpy or constant entropy this inequality becomes, respectively,</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>d<i>S<sub>H,P</sub></i> &ge; 0, &emsp; d<i>H<sub>S,P</sub></i> &le; 0 &emsp; (constant <i>P</i>, no additional work)</p>
</div>

<p>The entropy of the system at constant pressure must increase if its enthalpy remains constant, for there can then be no change in entropy of the surroundings). Alternatively, the enthalpy must decrease if the entropy of the system is constant, for then it is essential to have an increase in entropy of the surroundings.</p>

<p>None of these three criteria for spontaneuos change is immediately useful in the chemistry laboratory where processes are carried out at constant temperature and volume or, more frequentely, at constant temperature and pressure.</p>

<p>From</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>d<i>A</i> = d<i>U</i> &minus; <i>T</i>d<i>S</i></p>
</div>

<p>we know that at constant volume <i>T</i>d<i>S</i> &ge; d<i>U</i>, which implies that</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>d<i>A<sub>T,V</sub></i> &le; 0</p>
</div>

<p>Thus for any irreversible process at constant <i>T</i> and <i>V</i>, the Helmholtz energy <i>A</i> decreases, and for a reversible process it is consntant.</p>
