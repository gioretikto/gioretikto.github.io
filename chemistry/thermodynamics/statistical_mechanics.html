<h1>Statistical Mechanics</h1>
      
<p>The link between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics is provided by <b>statistical mechanics</b>, whose aim is to deduce the macroscopic properties of matter from the properties of the molecules composing the system. Typical macroscopic properties are entropy, internal energy, heat capacity, surface tension, dielectric constant, viscosity, electrical conductivity, and chemical reaction rate. Molecular properties include molecular masses, molecular geometries, intramolecular forces (which determine the molecular vibration frequencies), and intermolecular forces. Because of the huge number of molecules in a macroscopic system, one uses statistical methods instead of attempting to consider the motion of each molecule in the system.</p>

<p>This chapter is restricted to <b>equilibrium statistical mechanics</b> (also called <b>statistical thermodynamics</b>), which deals with systems in thermodynamic equilibrium. Nonequilibrium statistical mechanics (whose theory is not as well developed as that of equilibrium statistical mechanics) deals with transport properties and chemical reaction rates.</p>

<p>The <b>macrostate</b> means the <i>thermodynamic state</i> of a system, defined solely on the basis of macroscopic variables and does not require knowledge of the underlying microscopic configuration of the system, which is what we call its microstate. For example, the macrostate of an ideal gas made up of a single chemical species is fully specified by its temperature and its pressure, from which we can calculate all of its other macroscopic parameters, such as molar volume, internal energy, enthalpy and entropy (we shall see how). Although this macroscopic specification of the sate of a system is independent of any knowledge of its underlying microscopic structure.</p>

<p>The term <b>microstate</b> means the quantum state of a system. We define all microstates that give rise to the same macrostate as being equivalent.</p>

<h2>Quantum states, energy states and thermodynamic states</h2>

<p>The quantum mechanical state of N molecules in a volume V interacting with known intra- and intermolecular potentials is described by N-molecule wave functions Œ® n (r 1 ,r 2 ,...,r N ) with corresponding discrete N-molecule energies, E<sub>n</sub> . It may not be possible to directly determine the states of the interacting N-molecule system, but for present purposes, we only need to know that such discrete quantum states exist.</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>ƒ§&Psi;<sub>j</sub> = E<sub>j</sub>&Psi;<sub>j</sub></i> &emsp;&emsp; <i>j</i> = 1, 2,3, ...</p>
</div>

<p>The possible wave functions <i>&Psi;<sub>j</sub></i> and quantum energies <i>E<sub>j</sub></i> will depend on the composition of the system (since the number of molecules and the intermolecular and intramolecular forces depend on the composition) and will depend on the system‚Äôs volume [recall that the translational energy of a particle in a cubic box depends on the volume of the box since <i>a<sup>2</sup> = V<sup>2/3</sup></i>]. We have</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>E<sub>j</sub> = E<sub>j</sub></i> (<i>V, N<sub>B</sub>, N<sub>C</sub></i>, ...)</p>
</div>

<p>where the system‚Äôs composition is specified by giving <i>N<sub>B</sub>, N<sub>C</sub></i>, ... , the number of molecules of each chemical species B, C, ... in the system. Note that <i>E<sub>j</sub></i> does not depend on the system‚Äôs temperature. Temperature is a macroscopic nonmechanical property and does not appear in the quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian of the system or in the condition that the wave functions be well behaved.</p>

<p>For an ideal gas, the total energy <i>E<sub>j</sub></i>(<i>N,V</i>) is the sum of molecular energies</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>E<sub>j</sub></i>(<i>N,V</i>) = <i>&epsilon;<sub>1</sub>+&epsilon;<sub>2</sub>+ ... + &epsilon;<sub>N</sub></i> &emsp;&emsp; (17.0)</p>
</div>

<p>perch√® le molecole di un gas ideale sono indipendenti tra loro. Per esempio, per un gas ideale monoatomico in un contenitore cubico avente i lati di lunghezza <i>a</i>, se ignoriamo gli stati elettronici e ci concentriamo solamente sugli stati traslazionali, allora gli &epsilon;<sub>j</sub> sono proprio le energie traslazionali date da</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&epsilon;<sub>n<sub>x</sub>n<sub>y</sub>n<sub>z</sub></sub></i> = <i>h<sup>2</sup></i> (<i>n<sub>x</sub>n<sub>y</sub>n<sub>z</sub></i>) / 8m<i>a<sup>2</sup></i>&emsp;&emsp; (17.1)</p>
</div>

<p>Notare che <i>E<sub>j</sub></i>(<i>N,V</i>) dipende da <i>N</i> attraverso il numero di termini che appaiono nell'equazione 17.0 e da <i>V</i> per il fatto che si ha <i>a = V<sup>1/3</sup></i> nell'equazione 17.1 e che non vi √® diependenza dalla <i>T</i> del sistema. Temperature is a macroscopic nonmechanical property and does not appear in the quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian of the system or in the condition that the wave functions be well behaved.</p>

<p>Per un sistema pi√π generale in cui le particelle interagiscono tra loro, la <i>E<sub>j</sub>(N,V)</i> non si pu√≤ scrivere come somma di singole energie particelle, ma possiamo ancora considerare l'insieme di energie macroscopiche permesse {<i>E<sub>j</sub>(N,V)</i>} almeno in principio.</p>

<p>Ci√≤ che vogliamo fare ora √® determinare la probabilit√† che un sistema si trovi nello stato <i>j</i> con energia <i>E<sub>j</sub>(N,V)</i>. Per fare questo, consideriamo un'enorme collezione di tali sistemi in contatto termico con un bagno termico essenzialmente infinito (chiamato serbatoio di calore) alla temperatura <i>T</i>. Ciascun sistema possiede gli stessi valori di <i>N,V,T</i>, ma √® probabile che si trovi in uno stato quantico differente, compatibile con i vlaori di <i>N</i> e <i>V</i>. An ensemble of systems each having fixed <i>T, V</i>, and composition is called a <b>canonical ensemble</b>. Canonical means standard, basic, authoritative. The name was chosen by Gibbs.</p></p>


<h2>Canonical Ensemble</h2>

<p>Consider a system as shown in Figure 6.3a, with N molecules confined in a container of fixed volume V with heat conducting walls that allow the exchange of energy between the system and its surroundings (called the ‚Äúbath‚Äù), which are at temperature T. Instead of analyzing this setup with an individual system, we place a collection of ùìê replicats of the sytem (the <i>ensemble</i> of system) in thermal contact with each other in the large macroscopic thermostated bath at temperature <i>T</i>, as shown in schematically in Figure 6.3b. The bath surrounding the ensemble is infinitely large and the exchange of energy between the system replicas and the bath does not change the temperature of the bath. Each system in the ensemble can exchange energy with both the bath and other systems in the ensemble. The ensemble and bath are allowed to equilibrate. After equilibration, we remove the ensemble of systems from contact with the bath and surround it with a thermally insulating wall, as shown in Figure 6.3c. In this state, the member systems of the ensemble still exchange energy with each other through their heat conducting walls, but the ensemble as a whole is isolated from the environment. When isolated, the ensemble of systems has a constant total energy ùìî. The number of systems in the ensemble ùìê and the total ensemble energy ùìî are not physically measurable quantities since the ensemble is a theoretical construct. These quantities are ultimately eliminated from the final results of the analysis. The total ensemble energy ùìî is not related to the energies <i>E<sub>j</sub></i> of the <i>N</i>-molecule quantum states of each system. The particular ensemble shown in Figure 6.3 where member systems all have the same <i>N, V</i>, and <i>T</i> and can exchange energy is called a <b>canonical ensemble</b>.</p> 

<p>In the ensemble, the systems are distributed among their accessible quantum states such that there are <i>A<sub>1</sub></i> systems in the N-molecule quantum state with energy <i>E<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub></i> systems in the quantum state with energy <i>E<sub>2</sub></i>, or generally, <i>A<sub>j</sub></i> systems in the state with energy <i>E<sub>j</sub></i> The ensemble is characterized by a set of distributions with occupancy numbers <i>A<sub>i</sub></i>, represented in vector form as <i><b>A</b></i> = {<i>A<sub>i</sub></i>}. Any distribution of the system among the states must satisfy the conditions</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>&Sum;<sub>j</sub> A<sub>j</sub> = ùìê <br>
&Sum;<sub>j</sub> <i>A<sub>j</sub>E<sub>j</sub> =  ùìî</p>
</div>

<p>Each distinguishable system 1, ..., ùìê in the ensemble can be identified and its quantum state determined. For an ensemble distribution characterized by occupancies <b>A</b>, the number of ways of assigning the systems so that there are A<sub>1</sub> systems in state &Psi;<sub>1</sub> with energy E<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub> in state &Psi;<sub>2</sub> with energies E<sub>2</suB>, and so on is calculated from the multinomial expansion</p>
