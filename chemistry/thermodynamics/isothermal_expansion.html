<h1>Isothermal reversible expansion or compression of a closed ideal gas</h1>

<p>Let us consider the reversible isothermal expansion of a monoatomic ideal gas from the state (<i>V<sub>i</sub>, T</i>) to the state (<i>V<sub>f</sub>, T</i>) where <i>V<sub>f</sub> &gt; V<sub>i</sub></i>. The gas is placed in thermal contact with a heat reservoir at the temperature <i>T</i>, and by slowly reducing the weight on the piston by removing one grain of sand at a time, the pressure exerted by the gas is only infinitesimally greater than the instantaneous pressure exerted by the piston on the gas. The gas passes through a continuum of equilibrium states in going from the state <i>(V<sub>i</sub>, T)</i> to (<i>V<sub>f</sub>, T</i>). Since the process is never out of equilibrium, the process is reversibile.</p>

<p>From the First Law</p>

<p>&Delta;<i>U = q + w</i></p>

<p>We have seen that the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperatura. Hence &Delta; <i>U</i> = 0, and thus <i>q = âˆ’w</i>; that is, the work done by the exanding gas on the piston equals the heat absorbed from the environment into the gas. This is an example of a process in which the heat absorbed is converted entirely into work with 100 percent efficiency. The process does not violate fundamental limitations on efficiency, however, because a single expansion by itself is not a cyclic process. The added heat must end up as work done on the surroundings.</p> We have already calculated the work as:</p>

<p>Since <i>V<sub>f</sub> &gt; V<sub>i</sub></i> is a positive quantity, in accordance with the fact that work is done by the gas.</p>
