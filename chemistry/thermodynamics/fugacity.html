<h1>Fugacity</h1>

<p>The presence of molecular interactions distinguish the real gases from ideal gases where the molccular interactions are completely absent. For a real gas <i>V<sub>m</sub> &ne; RT/P</i> and hence d<i>u &ne; RT d ln<i>P</i>. Since the ideal gas equations are not directly applicable to real gases, we are faced with a problem. We can either sacrifice the equations or the variable. If we abandon the general equation of chemical potential then we have to use various equations of state fitting with <i>P-V-T</i> data. The use of such equations of state will make the treatment more complicated. So we find it easier to retain the general form of the chemical potential and to define a new variable which has the dimensions and general propertics of pressure. The new variable is called the <b>fugacity</b>, which is derived from the Latin <i>fugere</i>, to flee, and means literally “escaping tendency’. It is denoted by <i>f</i>. It is a corrected pressure which applies to real gases. All the effects arising due to interactions are contained in <i>f<i>. The chemical potential of a pure rcal gas can be expressed in a form</p>

<div class="eq">
<p><i>&mu; = &mu;<sup>°</sup> + RT</i> ln (<i>f</i>/atm)</p>
</div>

<p>&mu;<sup>°</sup> is the standard chemical potential at unit fugacity. At very low pressure</p>

<div class="eq">
<p>lim<sub>P &to; 0</sub> (f/P) = 1</p>
</div>

<p>The ratio (<i>f/P</i>) = &gamma; is called the <i>fugacity coefficient. For an ideal gas <i>f = P</i> and the fugacity coefficient is unity. For real gases (<i>f/P</i>) &ne; 1, <i>i.e.</i> fugacity is not the actual pressure.</p>
