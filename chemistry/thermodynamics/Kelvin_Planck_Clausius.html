<h1>Equivalence of Kelvin-Planck and Clausius statements</h1>

<p>We have studied the <a href="carnot.html">Kelvin-Planck</a> and <a href="refrigerators.html">Clausius</a> statements of the second law of thermodyanamics, the frsit refers to a heat engine and the latter refers to a refrigerator or heat pump: They can be stated as follows</p>

<p><b>Kelvin-Planck</b>. It is impossible for any device that operates in a cycle to receive heat from a single reservoir and produce a net amount of work. </p>

<p><b>Clausisu</b>. A transformation whose only final result is to transfer heat from a body at a given temperature to a body at a higher temperature is impossible.</p>

<p>Though it is hard to immediately see any commonality between the Clausius and Kelvin-Planck postulates, we shall prove that both are completely equivalent. In order to demonstrate their equivalence consider the following diagram. On the left we see a machine pump which violates the Kelvin-Planck postulate by transforming all heat, <i>Q<sub>H<sub></i> into work. This work output of the heat engine can be used to drive a refrigerator, which absorbs an amount of heat <i>Q<sub>C</sub></i> from a cold reservoir <i>T<sub>C</sub></i> and transmits an amount of heat (<i>Q<sub>C</sub> &minus; Q<sub>H</sub></i>) to an hot reservoir at <i>T<sub>H</sub></i>. If hte combination of the heat engine and the refrigerator is considered as a single sytem, as shown, then the result is a device that operates in a cycle and has no effect on the surroundings other thatn the transfer of heat <i>Q<sub>C</sub></i> from a cold reservoir to the higher temperature reservoir, violating Clausius statement.</p>

<p>Consider now the system shown in Fig. 4. In this system, a refrigerator is violating the Clausius statement as it transfers heat from a low temperature reservoir at <i>T<sub>C</sub></i> to a high temperature reservoir at <i>T<sub>H</sub></i> without any expenditure of work. Now let a heat engine, operating between the same heat reservoirs, receives an amount of heat <i>Q<sub>H</sub>'</i> from a high temperature reservoir at <i>T<sub>H</sub></i>, does work (<i>W = Q<sub>H</sub>' &minus; Q<sub>C</sub></i>) and rejectts an amount of heat <i>Q<sub>C</sub></i> to the low temperature reservoir at <i>T<sub>C</sub></i>. The combination of the refrigerator and heat engine is considered as a single system, as shown in Fig.3, then the result is a device that operated in a cycle whose sole effect is to remove heat at the (<i>Q<sub>h</sub> &minus; Q<sub>H</sub>'</i>) and convert it completely into an equivalent amount of work, thus violating the Kelvin-Planck statement.</p>

<p>The Kelvin-Planck and Clausius statements of the second law are thus seen to be equivalent.</p>
